1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:05,310
Have you just started to learn grid or you've been trying to learn it for a little while now and you just get bogged down in it because

2
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:08,020
There's just a lot of complexity with it, right?

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,413
There's all these new properties, there's new values, there's even new units.

4
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:15,601
And it can just seem like a little bit much, and maybe you already have some experience with Flexbox,

5
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:19,508
That always seems to get the job done for you, so why even bother with Grid?

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,792
Well, Grid can do things that Flexbox can't.

7
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:24,734
first of all, and actually I think if you simplify

8
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:28,043
grid down and start using it in very simple ways, it can actually be

9
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:33,487
easier to use and learn than Flexbox can, and that's why I want to look at how we can simplify Grid

10
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:35,435
and look at the easy ways to get working with it.

11
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,222
And we're going to be doing that in this video.

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,329
Hello my friend and friends and welcome back to yet another video.

13
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:45,296
I'm so glad that you've come to join me once again and

14
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:50,167
And if you're new here, my name is Kevin and here at my channel I help you fall madly deeply in love with CSS.

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:51,952
If not, fall in love with it.

16
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,901
I hope to at least make you a little bit less frustrated with it.

17
00:00:55,562 --> 00:01:01,171
And today we're doing that by exploring a topic that is one of my favorite things to use with CSS, which is CSS.

18
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,971
In simplifying GRID, I actually think there's different ways that we

19
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:05,975
can simplify it.

20
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:08,888
So I'm going to be breaking this down and we're going to be examining this layout

21
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,352
with two different approaches.

22
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:14,002
So one of them is going to be more of like a natural starting point I think for grid and just

23
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:19,105
understanding the very basics of how we can simplify Grid to get the layout that we want it to make for us.

24
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:24,352
And then the other approach, we're gonna sort of scrap what we did and take another way that I really like to work today.

25
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:28,985
and what I'd really encourage you to do is watch both of them and see which one speaks to you.

26
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:29,687
you a little bit more.

27
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,956
Some are more practical for some layouts, some are more practical for other layouts.

28
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:36,613
but for both of them I think they're very nice simple ways to approach things.

29
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:40,463
None of it's going to sink in you might watch both of them and go they both make a lot of sense

30
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:46,055
grid is easy and then try to use it and you might get stuck, make sure when you're learning something like this that you're practicing it.

31
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:51,513
But as much as possible, I'm trying to eliminate some properties, some things that we don't need to be using.

32
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:56,127
there are so many out there for grid, I want to focus on the ones that we do need to really understand it.

33
00:01:56,608 --> 00:02:00,875
and on the ones that we can use to simplify our life, especially with media queries and other things.

34
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:05,443
Alright so for this one I'm actually building out this layout that you can see here which is in Figma right now.

35
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:09,975
but this is from Frontend Mentor and I'm doing it just because I was trying to find a nice layout that we could build.

36
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,146
that would require gridding.

37
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,694
This looks pretty gritty to me.

38
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:19,766
So we're going to use this as our example, but what I've actually done is I've actually done quite a bit of work already.

39
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:25,278
in getting things styled, but I haven't applied anything to do with grid yet at all.

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,163
Now if you'd like to follow along the github repo for this is linked down below and I've included the starting css

41
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:35,914
so exactly what I have here and this style.css will be the finished version of it.

42
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:40,331
So if you want to follow along or play with what I have to start with, you can do just that.

43
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:45,321
and let's jump in there and here I have my testimonial grid and actually let's just go take a quick look at my

44
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:52,153
my markup and so basically I have my main here which I set as my testimonial grid

45
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:57,975
And then inside my main I've just put each one of these card type things as its own article with a class of

46
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:01,902
testimonial and a few other utility classes and things on there that aren't too important.

47
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:05,940
But what's really important is these are the direct children, these articles right here.

48
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:11,517
And so what I'm going to do is come over to my style where we have my testimonial grid and I think we know what we want to do.

49
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,750
The first thing to start with grid is we do need a display of grid.

50
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:17,727
And I won't tell you how many times I've actually forgotten to do that.

51
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:22,525
And when you do display grid, generally speaking, nothing will really change.

52
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,257
and this is actually one of the things I like about Grid compared to Flexbox.

53
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,904
Flexbox will work, it gives you the columns.

54
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:31,908
sometimes those columns don't do what you want them to do and you have to finick around a little bit and get things to you know

55
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:35,666
It can be a little bit strange if it doesn't do exactly what you want it to early on.

56
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:39,391
Whereas with Grid, you do display Grid, generally not much changes.

57
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:45,685
Sometimes if you had did it and there's paragraphs all of a sudden things might become double spaced because with grid and with

58
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:50,654
flex, the direct children, so the grid items or the flex items no longer have collapsing margins.

59
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:55,780
so that can be a little thing that can get in your way, but we have no margins between these, so absolutely nothing changes.

60
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:59,120
but we do need some spacing between them and this is where people

61
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:03,469
We'll sometimes use margin to create spacing or of course we have gap.

62
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:08,898
and I'm going to recommend GAP 100% of the time because we need vertical spacing and we need horizontal spacing.

63
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,203
vertical spacing and horizontal spacing.

64
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,386
I always get those backwards.

65
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,090
If you've been following for a while you know that.

66
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:19,468
And because we want this spacing to all be equal everywhere, gap makes a lot of sense.

67
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:23,010
But in general with the gap property by doing it, we don't get.

68
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:27,047
gaps on the outside of any elements and things like that like if you wanted to add margins

69
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,859
through a grid system of any kind, it gets a little bit annoying.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,793
even if it's just columns going across and you don't even have rows

71
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,501
I'd always, always, always recommend Gapnow.

72
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,483
I'm using less and less and less for little spacing things.

73
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:42,729
So let's come in, I think it's a 1.5 rem.

74
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:46,047
Maybe it's a two that looks pretty good.

75
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:47,176
So I'll stick with that and

76
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:50,971
we're started we have a grid and we have my gap and one of the first things I'm going to say

77
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:54,821
is if you are working with Grid, make sure that you use your DevTools.

78
00:04:55,684 --> 00:05:00,543
I'm going to open those and in my DevTools, I'm going to be bringing them off screen just so it doesn't take up.

79
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:01,464
too much room.

80
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:04,770
But what I'm going to do, I'm in the accessibility tab.

81
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,613
Let's go and just go to my inspector.

82
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:11,218
Here I have this grid on here and this is a little toggle.

83
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,320
I am in Firefox.

84
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,788
and I like Firefoxes especially for demos because things are much bigger and easier to see.

85
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:19,407
We're going to be looking at our line numbers and a few other things.

86
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,418
Chrome has all of these things too.

87
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,287
It has the area names, it has line numbers.

88
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,212
and these visualizations.

89
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,739
So whichever browser you're in, it works almost exactly the same.

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,604
You can see your grid, you can change the color of the grid.

91
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,026
So actually, let's go to a darker color.

92
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,433
just so we can see it a bit better.

93
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,223
Maybe something like

94
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:42,881
Just wait, something that pops, a real red, but something that pops a bit on our layout.

95
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,471
And again, you can do that Chrome or Firefox

96
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,398
And Safari, actually.

97
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,267
Safari's new Chrome Inspector is really, really good.

98
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,979
There's some scrolling issues sometimes you might get with overlaying grids and stuff.

99
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,892
Safari's new one is surprisingly powerful and good.

100
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,649
That's what happens when Jen Simmons is on the team.

101
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:09,527
So we have display grid that's there we can see my gaps that are coming in now and but we of course need some columns

102
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,905
And this is the first thing I'm going to say.

103
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:16,292
If you are setting up a grid and you're not really comfortable with using grids,

104
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,547
One of the hardest things to know is how many columns you might need.

105
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:23,223
So I'm actually going to come on here and I'm going to grab my pen tool.

106
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:26,891
not my pen tool, my pencil tool, which I don't know the shortcut of because I never use it.

107
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:32,895
Um, but we're going to pull that open and I always, always recommend, and we can't see it cause there we go.

108
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:33,837
we can see it now.

109
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:38,968
Figma chooses the color of it based on the background and I was drawing on the purple so I chose a white pencil.

110
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,493
So there's the container that I'm inside.

111
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,254
That's my main grid.

112
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:47,503
And then I clearly need to have something that goes here, but that does need to come into this area here.

113
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:48,725
So let's highlight that in white too.

114
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,411
Just that line continues here.

115
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:53,903
Here's the nice, easy one that goes all the way down like that.

116
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:59,099
But look, oh, we have another, you know, we're looking up here and you might go, I need a big one, a small one and a small one.

117
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,852
But don't forget over here, this gets split too, so I need to split this one across like that as well.

118
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:09,425
This is where it can really help you visualize how many rows and how many columns you actually need.

119
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:15,896
Because when you're looking at a design, sometimes you miss things and sometimes you need three rows instead of two or six rows instead of four.

120
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,474
3 depending on what you need to do.

121
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:24,368
Even now I get tripped up sometimes and I eventually get it if I'm not drawing on top of it and this takes three seconds to do.

122
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,357
and then it just makes it a lot easier.

123
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,889
So I know I need one, two, three, four columns.

124
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:33,057
I also need to have two rows, but I'm not going to declare them.

125
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm going to talk more about that soon.

126
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:38,705
I'm only going to declare my columns for now, so I'm going to say grid.

127
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:44,838
template columns which is how we can declare our columns because we're setting up our template so it's

128
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,407
the template columns that the items will live on so grid template columns and there's

129
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,683
One unit, if you're new to Grid, will go slowly with this.

130
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:58,761
So here I'm just gonna make this a bit bigger to give myself a bit more room so we can see everything I'm gonna write

131
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,994
And grid template columns, we have to say what they're going to be.

132
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,380
So you could come in here and say I have 100 pixels.

133
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,624
and I'm just going to do one and hit save.

134
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,607
And now I have one column that's 100 pixels.

135
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,249
and then I can just put a space and do 100 pixels and now I have two columns.

136
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:15,496
And then I could say pixels and have three columns.

137
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:16,377
Cool.

138
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,441
That works really well.

139
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,686
Another one you can do is come in with percentages, 25%, 25.

140
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,914
and 25% and okay so that's working too.

141
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:32,007
and it might look like it's not working but it's because it's hiding so there we go we have three columns going all the way across that way

142
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:36,420
And one thing we want to do is actually divide this space up equally.

143
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:39,853
So one way we can do that is with the FR unit.

144
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,687
So 1fr and this is a new grid only

145
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,723
or I won't say new, because it's been around for a while, but it's a grid-only unit.

146
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:51,090
which sort of uses the Flexbox algorithm from what I understand of it.

147
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,033
And it's basically a fraction.

148
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,936
So one fraction, one fraction, one fraction.

149
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,500
So we're saying divide all of those up equally.

150
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,080
You can do more with FRs than this.

151
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:03,536
I find most of the time you just want nice even columns.

152
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,216
And so this is a really nice way to get it, to say each one is getting an equal amount of space.

153
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:12,674
There is more complexity to how this works, but we're not going to dive into that.

154
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,658
We want to keep things simple.

155
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:19,969
and almost every time you use it that's going to be the result that you get is three equal columns or if you did five you get five

156
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,873
equal columns so on and so forth.

157
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,121
Now I'm going to make this guy a little bigger again because

158
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:30,790
What happens with grid is sometimes you end up doing that where I just said five so you end up actually putting in five and

159
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:36,036
Then when you want like to change this it's a little frustrating or even typing it out 1fr 1fr 1fr

160
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:41,444
it's kind of annoying and they realized a lot of the time we're going to want equal for all of them.

161
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:47,059
So that's where we have the repeat function that we can use and in repeat you say how many times you want to repeat it.

162
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,266
put a comma, and then say what you want to do.

163
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:51,434
So let's put 100 pixels again, just so we can see that working.

164
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,080
and so it's repeated three columns at 100 pixels.

165
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:56,745
But of course, I don't want 100 pixels.

166
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:57,788
We saw that FR works.

167
00:09:58,028 --> 00:09:59,251
So I can just say 3 and 1FR.

168
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,341
and that gives me three columns that are one FR each.

169
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:07,976
Except of course, I just set this to three, but just thinking back, we actually want that to be four, right?

170
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:08,939
There we go.

171
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,843
Because again, why is it four?

172
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:11,504
Let's go look.

173
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,486
We have 1, 2, 3, 4 columns on my layout.

174
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,572
not three.

175
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:15,656
That was a little silly of me.

176
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:16,440
There we go.

177
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,251
So we get my four columns going across and

178
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:25,427
You'll notice I haven't set any rows yet, and actually for now, let's bring this back to three because it looks a little nicer for the moment.

179
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,214
And we'll go back to four in a second.

180
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:31,068
I just want to talk a little bit about setting grid template rows.

181
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,015
because I think this is one of those places where people add complexity that they don't need to add.

182
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:40,717
Because notice if I say there's three columns, my content, if I have more than three...

183
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:45,887
So when I have more than three children in here, like these articles, if I have more than three of them, they just go, oh,

184
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,429
I got to the third column.

185
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,032
There's no more columns in this.

186
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:51,035
I'm going to create a row and come down here.

187
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:55,259
and this is where you might hear the terms implicit and explicit grid.

188
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,486
So this is where I've explicitly declared three columns.

189
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,170
So I've said there are three columns.

190
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:04,728
I haven't said how many rows there are, so the grid is creating new rows for me.

191
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,234
as it needs to and these are implicit rows because it's just going there's

192
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:13,169
content here that needs somewhere to live, I'm going to make that space automatically without you telling me to do that.

193
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:17,751
And as much as with the web in general, we're so used to like.

194
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:23,602
item you know the auto height where it just grows by itself we place new items they stack on top of each other by default

195
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:29,431
We're very used to that idea of new things just sort of coming in and going where they should go automatically.

196
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,474
So when I can, I try not to declare grid template rows.

197
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:39,246
I will declare it when I need to when I very specific grids where I'm trying to do very specific things that need a bit of

198
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:43,368
finicking around and a bit of finessing and a little bit of other stuff going on.

199
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,511
but for the most part.

200
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:51,107
You can get away with grid template rows and not declaring grid template columns.

201
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:54,458
And if that's the case, I strongly recommend that you do that.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,730
because it just gives you a lot less overhead and a lot less to think about when you're making it.

203
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,825
just because you just have to worry about your rows and everything just sort of falls into place from there.

204
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:06,678
and what I'm doing here with these explicit columns is I'm saying also how big they have to be

205
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:11,311
Whereas with those rows that it's implicitly creating, or these automatically created rows,

206
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,097
It's just doing what it needs to do.

207
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:15,285
It's matching the height of the tallest one.

208
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:15,927
basically.

209
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:18,013
So that's a lot like how Flexbox works, right?

210
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:19,678
If you do display flex, they just.

211
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:21,763
all match the height of the tallest item.

212
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,507
You can change this behavior

213
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:27,974
and you can get control on your auto rows or auto columns if you fall into that world.

214
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:32,452
but we want to keep things simple for now, so I'm not going to get into that, but it is a possibility.

215
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:34,442
But let's keep things as simple as we can.

216
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,614
So every time you're going to do a display grid,

217
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,527
You'll probably want to set a gap on there, and then you're going to set up some columns.

218
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:44,377
Then if you need to start worrying about more, but we're not going to do that.

219
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,342
We're going to let's fix this we go back up to four

220
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,874
and let's start trying to get this layout to work for us a little bit.

221
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:49,698
And so let's go look

222
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:55,668
back at our layout and we have this one here and this one here that need to span across two columns each.

223
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:58,628
So let's go and create something that can allow us to do that.

224
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:04,283
And what I really like for this type of thing, instead of trying to find a class, a specific class that

225
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,706
for each one of those and writing it twice.

226
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,249
I'm going to come here and I'm just going to write a dot grid.

227
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,926
Span two and I could call this just you know span two I guess if I wanted to

228
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:19,894
I just like being really explicit this class should be used with

229
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:20,234
grid.

230
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:21,235
So I start with grid.

231
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,399
It's just sort of a little naming convention, but you can name it however you want.

232
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,763
You might be saying, well, there's no other way to span.

233
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:29,308
There is the multi-column layout.

234
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,293
It actually does have spans and it did before Grid even existed, I believe.

235
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,497
And it's a little bit different in how that works.

236
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,319
What we're going to do is send my grid column.

237
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,260
And even here, I guess this could be grid call.

238
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:49,665
call span2 just in case you end up with row span2s so let's do that grid call span2

239
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,933
And so my grid column will be, you want to guess?

240
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:53,755
Span 2.

241
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:54,918
Isn't that so easy?

242
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,104
Grid column is a shorthand property and we're going to

243
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:04,490
to explore that a little bit more shortly, but one nice thing is when you just need to throw spans on stuff

244
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:05,775
It just works.

245
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:07,284
It doesn't matter that it's a shorthand.

246
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:08,511
It puts it sort of where you

247
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:11,151
where it should go because you could actually put the span on.

248
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:12,658
the start or the end.

249
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,022
Anyway, that's going to work.

250
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:14,885
I'm going to hit save.

251
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,413
So it's here and we'll go over to my HTML.

252
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:22,481
And we're going to add that in two spots where you need it on my first one.

253
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:23,904
So this is my first article.

254
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:29,739
grid call span two if you're saying that's a long class name it is but that's okay

255
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:34,224
I like longer class names if they really explain to me what they're doing.

256
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:34,885
That's fine.

257
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:38,861
I don't want like a GCS2 or something because then I'll never remember them.

258
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:42,611
and I'll never really know what it's for, or if somebody else comes to my code, they don't know.

259
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,664
Whereas this, it's very explicit.

260
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:45,751
If somebody were to come across

261
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:51,742
this they see it there's a grid and they see these are grid column span too it's just super clear so I like clear

262
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,160
class names that explain exactly what they're doing.

263
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,528
So let's hit save here and see, wow, look at that.

264
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,447
Now, there's some weird funkiness coming up over here because this one is now so long

265
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:07,381
and it's mucking this up, because remember they're stretching to try and match each other's heights, but that's okay.

266
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:09,306
We've made some nice progress.

267
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,074
Where the real issue is actually coming from.

268
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:15,595
is this one is in the wrong spot, but I put it there on purpose.

269
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:20,366
And not on purpose because of it would actually make more sense if this was one to

270
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:23,344
Three whoops, let's get that in black three

271
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,437
four, five, right?

272
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,343
Because then that would be the order I see them in here.

273
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:34,513
The thing is, in this Figma design, we have a mobile layout too, and Janet is the third one.

274
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:36,196
That's the third one here.

275
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:37,578
I like working mobile first.

276
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:38,480
We're gonna talk about

277
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,550
the media queries in a second though.

278
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:41,858
But right now we need to get

279
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:46,280
this one over here or Kira over here, one or the other.

280
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:51,764
And to do that there's lots of different approaches and different ways we could do something like that.

281
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:57,139
This is where for me utility classes don't quite work just because

282
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:00,839
You're placing things in very specific spots or moving things around.

283
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:05,213
I just find it easier to actually target the class that I want to work on.

284
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:09,168
And I could actually just give this specific one a class.

285
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,256
And target it because if I look here that it's all very generic my classes.

286
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,237
I have testimonial the

287
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,247
background colors and a few other things going on there, but it's all very generic classes to style this up.

288
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,576
So there's different ways of selecting it just for simplicity sake.

289
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:27,041
and not worrying about creating a class for it.

290
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,567
I am going to use the nth child selector.

291
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:33,497
Or I'll choose the last child selector, I guess, just because it's going to be faster for now.

292
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,024
If you want to make this a little bit more plug and play.

293
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:39,744
you could then actually give them very specific classes that could make this work.

294
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:41,931
But this is my test.

295
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:42,973
It is a testimonial.

296
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,580
So we're gonna say testimonial.

297
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:50,448
last child and Because that's going to select the last child.

298
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:51,570
Let's say background

299
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:57,921
red important just to see there you go we can see that it's actually selecting the one that we want it to

300
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,601
to select so let's get rid of that and

301
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:06,201
Now we can get a little bit more about placing items on the grid when they're not going where you want them to go.

302
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:09,133
And this is where line numbers really come in.

303
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,565
And I've had my grid overlay on this entire time.

304
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,417
It's really important when you're using your grid overlay, which is change colors on me.

305
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,145
This happens sometimes when things refresh.

306
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:21,419
even though it's still set to red here, just because it makes it a bit easier to see on top of the purple.

307
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:23,671
I'll change that back to red.

308
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,358
But even if you're not working with it on all the time,

309
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,216
If you're going to touch your line numbers, I highly, highly, highly recommend

310
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,511
that you go ahead and have this on.

311
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,395
because seeing the line numbers makes it so much easier to work with.

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,587
and so I want it to be on my column 4 to my column 5.

313
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,108
And we want it from, let's go look actually at the Figma design.

314
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,728
I want it to be from the top here and go all the way down to the bottom on this side.

315
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,310
So to be able to do that, let's start with the column.

316
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,632
So we're going to get this in the right spot.

317
00:17:58,153 --> 00:17:59,435
So we saw the grid column.

318
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:02,270
Property before so I'm saying

319
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:07,409
before we said span2 so let's just do that for fun span2 just to see that it whoops we need that

320
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:08,254
it works.

321
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,725
It goes across the two like that.

322
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:10,734
But in this

323
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:12,476
case I don't want to be doing a span2.

324
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:15,039
I actually want to say start at line number 4.

325
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,169
So we can actually just put grid column 4 and it will start at line 4 and it leaves this one empty.

326
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:22,940
Why is it doing that?

327
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,504
What's happening?

328
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,580
So grid column, as I mentioned, is a shorthand.

329
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,685
And the shorthand is for grid column start.

330
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,046
and my grid column end.

331
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,855
And basically if I just do a grid columns

332
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:40,002
like that for it's just putting it as a grid column start and it's

333
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:43,956
not putting a GridColumnEnd just because it doesn't even need to do that.

334
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,442
We don't really need a GridColumnEnd.

335
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,968
but just for fun I could put three here and we could

336
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,488
say that the grid or let's do a start grid column start is at three

337
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:57,028
and grid column end is at 5, and we get the same idea as the span 2.

338
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:01,047
The reason I prefer Span 2 when I can use it,

339
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:06,339
is because here, the span-2 class is working for this one, and it's working for this one over here.

340
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,072
It doesn't matter where they are and even we're going to end up moving this one over in a minute.

341
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:13,283
And it doesn't matter where they are, where they're lining up.

342
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:16,861
expand to you is just saying it doesn't matter where you start.

343
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:20,329
but the end we just want to make sure we're spanning across two columns.

344
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,795
So this one's a little bit more versatile than long

345
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,668
locking in with specific line numbers.

346
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,180
don't create rows unless you need to create rows.

347
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,404
Don't start using line numbers unless you need to use line numbers.

348
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:36,778
Start as simple as possible and add the complexity as you need to to be able to get the layout that you need.

349
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,640
So, first display grid, then my gap.

350
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,205
Then I set up my columns.

351
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,048
Then I go, oh, I need a few of these to span.

352
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:46,032
So I make a very general, generic way to span columns.

353
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,857
I'm not saying you're going from 1 to 3 and then oh you're going from 4 to or 2 to 4 or whatever.

354
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,255
we need to get that one too.

355
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:58,569
We actually, in this case, we can get rid of the end, because I don't need to worry about that, but we need it to start at four.

356
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,475
So we need it to be here, but I also need it to move up.

357
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:02,838
I need it starting at the top.

358
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,976
So I'm going to come here and then this is when I'm finally going to worry.

359
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:13,248
about my row so we can do grid row and we can do start on here and where do we want it to start at the top at one

360
00:20:13,368 --> 00:20:16,433
Oh my goodness, it's all coming together so quickly.

361
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:17,294
What happened?

362
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:19,678
Why did everything just fall into place again?

363
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,111
Start simple, start moving things, and all of a sudden your layout might come together more than you think.

364
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:28,536
And so by saying grid row start one, let's take this one off.

365
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:32,392
It's going in the order of the DOM.

366
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:33,295
So this is the...

367
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:36,864
You know what, let's choose the third one here.

368
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:40,370
Testimonial.

369
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,608
And child three.

370
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:46,068
Background red.

371
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:49,006
important.

372
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:52,793
I just want to highlight that this is my third one in my DOM.

373
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,714
So it's one, two, three.

374
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,758
The third one is going here because that's just following the natural flow that the items will go in.

375
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:02,989
first column, second column, third column, it just goes and he goes, Oh, we're out of room.

376
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:03,732
I'm going to go down.

377
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:08,107
I'm going to go to where this guy is and then we get that one and then it sort of moves across from there.

378
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:11,989
As soon as I do grid row start one, I'm saying I need you.

379
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:16,116
Your grid column start is four, so you're living in this box.

380
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:20,282
but I also need you to start at line number one, which is the very top.

381
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:26,252
So as soon as I do that and I save that, it has to live here, which means this one can't live there.

382
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:31,492
so that it pushes down into the next empty cell that it can find and it just automatically goes there.

383
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:35,372
even though this is the third one in the DOM, it's grid smart.

384
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:39,394
And you can overlap and actually overlapping content with grid is just it's

385
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:41,918
It's wonderful, but it won't do it by default.

386
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:44,743
You have to work at it a little bit to actually get things to overlap.

387
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:50,136
So that gets pushed up this falls down over here because that's the next

388
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:51,881
empty cell that was available to it.

389
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:53,366
So awesome.

390
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,936
And I guess we can turn that red off now.

391
00:21:55,976 --> 00:21:56,599
We don't need that.

392
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:01,234
And the last thing is we need this to fill up all that space.

393
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:06,103
you know, these are stretching, they look really ugly, but as soon as this is allowed to stretch, it should fix that problem.

394
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:08,143
So how can we do that?

395
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:12,208
Hopefully you've already come up with an idea or two where we can come in with a grid row.

396
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,991
And there's a few options.

397
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:18,016
I could choose my three, because remember we have a one here.

398
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:23,217
my line number two here or and my line number three down here so I could throw a three

399
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:24,947
And then the layout is done.

400
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,064
you might have said, well, I can do a span.

401
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:29,229
And you're right, you could.

402
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,912
You could say span2.

403
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:35,107
and then it's gonna start at the top and span across two, exact same result.

404
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:36,350
There's no difference between them.

405
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:39,269
So there we go, we're spanning across the two of them that way.

406
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,000
Another option is to use the shorthand.

407
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:43,647
So instead of writing all of this

408
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:49,400
When you use the shorthand, you do grid row, and then you're saying, where do you want it to start?

409
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:51,168
And then where do you want it to end?

410
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,762
So 1 over 3 will start at line number 1.

411
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:58,345
and go two to three, or you could do one over span.

412
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,608
and that will give you the exact same result.

413
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,712
and you can just in this case where you're declaring

414
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:10,556
a starting row using whether it's a span or whether it's something else, it doesn't matter too much.

415
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:14,924
if you like the idea of this actually being utility class just like I did before.

416
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:18,318
You could come in and create something like that, a grid.

417
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:23,419
row span two and do a grid grid

418
00:23:24,242 --> 00:23:29,077
row span two and use that in conjunction with a grid row start

419
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,292
There's the possibility with things like that that because this is a shorthand,

420
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:36,787
it might actually get overridden and you can run into a little bit of finickiness.

421
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:41,153
So if I need to do a specific starting line,

422
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:46,988
or a specific ending line or anything like that, I tend to declare it on the selector where I'm working instead of using YouTube.

423
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,831
class but if I don't need to declare anything specific

424
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:55,308
That's why I like the utility classes that work based on just where its natural flow is.

425
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,912
And we're going to get to the media queries in one second.

426
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:01,538
I just want to recap a little bit of the simplicity of this and I've gone over it before.

427
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,882
but first display grid because we need it.

428
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,107
Gap because that makes our spacing and all our life easier there.

429
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:08,931
and then set up your columns.

430
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,097
Don't set up rows unless you have to.

431
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,668
We didn't have to in this case, even though we did have to span multiple rows.

432
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:19,746
pretty nice and pretty neat and I think makes things a lot easier to maintain and a lot easier to think about.

433
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,515
We can use spans just to span columns.

434
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:24,978
It doesn't matter where things are starting.

435
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:30,366
And then if you need to, we can do specific things of start in this exact location.

436
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:34,339
or start here and end over here and different things like that.

437
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:39,722
Always do as general as possible and as generic as possible.

438
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:44,566
simplify things as much as possible, and then when you need to get very specific,

439
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:48,944
then add that specificness to your grid just to get things to fall where they need to.

440
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:51,389
A lot of the time you don't even need stuff like this.

441
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,316
This is really when you're getting into these weird layouts like this where things are sort of getting a little

442
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:55,878
fancier.

443
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:57,945
And next we want our media queries.

444
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:58,807
So I'm going to open up

445
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,611
The shortcut is Shift-Command-M.

446
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,174
I don't know if that's probably a command.

447
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:08,215
and I'm guessing if you're on a Mac that is in your DevTools also.

448
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:13,609
I get asked a lot about this, so that's this little guy, not this little guy, this little guy in your DevTools.

449
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:17,702
And in Chrome, this exact same icon is on this side over here.

450
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:19,977
just because I always get asked about this.

451
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,149
I mentioned the nice thing with responsiveness in Grid.

452
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:29,344
So we will do an extra little stage in this that wouldn't really be for this layout specifically.

453
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:32,571
but let's fix this at the beginning and this is where

454
00:25:33,112 --> 00:25:35,886
I can actually leave everything I've done except for one thing.

455
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:39,413
There's a few little things we'll have to do, but I'm going to grab this grid template columns.

456
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:43,209
I'm going to remove it from here and hit save and let's see what happens.

457
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,013
We still have a layout.

458
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,591
And what I'm going to do is come here and say, add media.

459
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,801
And we'll just say a min width of 40m.

460
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:51,624
I'm just guessing.

461
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:54,744
And let's put in my testimonial.

462
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:58,213
grid and we're going to redefine my columns there.

463
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:03,854
One thing you'll notice is even though like actually just remove this we can see that we don't have anything

464
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:09,524
we actually have a bit of the layouts working even though I haven't declared my columns here.

465
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:13,507
But the column spacing has gotten a little much.

466
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,593
up because it's going to the auto spacings like this one is narrower

467
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:20,173
You can see here we have a really narrow column, here we have a bigger column.

468
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,157
So that's why I do like declaring them.

469
00:26:22,718 --> 00:26:24,621
The reason that it's just magically working

470
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,565
is because of this grid column start.

471
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:27,708
If I turn this off.

472
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,795
the whole thing falls apart.

473
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:34,062
But it's going, this has to be on the fourth column.

474
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:39,544
That means I need to have four columns for this to work, and then everything will just slot into those empty spaces.

475
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,792
So that's why we sort of have a layout right now.

476
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,884
But what we're going to say is actually let's put it right here.

477
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:49,972
my media query and then I'm going to grab this and also put it inside the media query.

478
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,597
And now we have this at my large screen sizes.

479
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:56,561
And then I think we should change where that's happening at.

480
00:26:57,143 --> 00:27:01,681
And actually I'm gonna bring this up to a 50 because it was getting a little bit narrow there And we can see there we go look at that

481
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:03,363
it's going and then it's working.

482
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:06,626
Except it's not really working because these are still spanning too.

483
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,510
This would depend a little bit on your layout, but I think most of the time.

484
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:15,024
your spans are going to be happening once the grid is sort of more defined.

485
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:16,992
and when things are kicking in.

486
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,940
So I'm also going to bring that utility class here.

487
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:20,325
This isn't the most organized.

488
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:21,347
CSS at the moment.

489
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:26,095
But just to say we want to start without any spans, without any columns, anything like that.

490
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:31,079
But I'm still using my display of grid at the small screen size because then I have my gap.

491
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,322
and all my spacing is there.

492
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:35,928
And actually, let's just turn off the inspector thing now.

493
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:41,486
So yeah, just for the purpose of having that gap, I think that's wonderful.

494
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:47,417
and then we get to our larger screen size and then we get our columns and everything falls in and then we go back down that way.

495
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:49,742
And so that works really, really nicely.

496
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:53,592
And it's just about keeping things organized within your media queries where you need them to be.

497
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:53,834
to be.

498
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:56,573
There are ways of working without media queries with

499
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:59,610
you might see it with like a repeat auto fit and other things like that that are

500
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,182
actually fairly easy to use but on a layout like this it just

501
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:06,215
it doesn't work and I don't want to dive into it because we're just adding

502
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:07,781
We're keeping grid simple today.

503
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,989
Hopefully this is still keeping it very simple for you.

504
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,952
and moving things into the media query, hopefully.

505
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:14,781
Doesn't throw you off too much there.

506
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:17,153
But again all of this code if you want to look at it a little

507
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:21,193
In more detail, the GitHub repo is linked below and you can access all the code there.

508
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:26,072
Now the last thing I want to talk about that I find actually simplifies things with Grid a little bit

509
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:29,727
And it's a way that I used to not want to work at.

510
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:34,497
all but I find when it comes to media queries and all of that it makes Grid just wonderful.

511
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,970
It does take a little bit more setup, but I find it's a nice

512
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:41,858
easy way to work with Grid when you have more complex layouts like this.

513
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:45,583
In doing this, we're also going to explore a few other properties that we haven't looked at yet.

514
00:28:46,384 --> 00:28:48,949
And so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to come and I'm going to delete.

515
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,771
all of this.

516
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:54,009
I'm going to leave the media query because we are going to need it but I'm going to delete all of that.

517
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:59,153
and we're left back where we started with our display grid at the very beginning.

518
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:04,847
And this is just another approach, it's why I'm breaking it sort of into two, but it's one of my favorite ways to work with Grid.

519
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,184
The way we just looked at i think is the best way to understand how great is working.

520
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,824
and the simple ways of setting up a nice simple grid.

521
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:16,924
This is when you need more complex layouts with a little bit more happening where things change a little bit more.

522
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:20,841
So we're going to break away from the actual design as well a little bit with this one.

523
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:24,357
And what I'm going to do is actually set up some grid template areas.

524
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,027
And with grid template areas, the syntax of it's a little weird.

525
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:31,432
but I always, always do it where I put it onto its own line.

526
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:36,403
Because the grid template areas tend to get a little bit complex and we're going to see that.

527
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:39,320
Once we get to the media query, it's going to have a little bit more going.

528
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:42,612
And it's also kind of weird because it does all go in strings.

529
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:47,472
I'm going to write one here and then I'm actually going to go on a new line and in quotations

530
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:51,429
It can be single or double quotations, three, four, five.

531
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:57,149
And five and I always forget my semicolon at the end.

532
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,312
So just don't forget at the end

533
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:01,456
After the last one you do need a semicolon and let's

534
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:06,023
hit save and let's see what that's actually done because this has done something even though we don't see a difference yet.

535
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:12,274
and to be able to see it once again we'll open up our visualization tools on my grid so we can open the grid here and

536
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:16,704
I have line numbers enabled so if you don't see the line areas my

537
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:23,395
area names are enabled so it's within the layout tab this is in chrome and in firefox

538
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:29,385
chrome it's these little little tabs that show up here whereas in firefox they're really just in your face so i like

539
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,552
the in-your-face ones a little bit pointer.

540
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:34,903
And we can see we have one, two, three, four, and five at the bottom.

541
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,023
Now, what's the point of this?

542
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:40,691
Let's go down into my media query.

543
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:43,741
And here we're going to write testemonial grid.

544
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:49,099
and we're going to say grid template areas and we're going to redefine them.

545
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:53,972
So let's come here and what we're going to say is we're going to match the design for now.

546
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:54,514
So it's a 1-1.

547
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,196
and five, right?

548
00:30:58,821 --> 00:30:59,904
Let's go back into Figma.

549
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:04,017
If you remember in the markup, this is 1, this is number 2, then this is number 3.

550
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:07,441
This is number four and then this one is number five and

551
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:08,705
And again, draw things.

552
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:11,954
So we have five here and five here, four there, four here.

553
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,708
Let's make that four all in white.

554
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,298
And we have a one there and a one here.

555
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,644
So we have area 1, 1, 2, 5.

556
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:20,999
And then we come down to this next row.

557
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,329
3 4 4 5 so i can write that and i usually don't number it like this i actually give them meaningful names but

558
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:28,350
it.

559
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,374
Um, so that was, uh, three, four, five.

560
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,098
For four or five for four or five.

561
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:36,801
And that was one one.

562
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:38,529
It wasn't 115, 1125.

563
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:38,871
There we go, 25.

564
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:45,244
And when we look at it here, what it did is it made one row for each of these.

565
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:48,111
So every set of quotation marks is going to be a row.

566
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:52,794
And so here we just had one by itself, two by itself, three by itself.

567
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:54,501
That's exactly what we see right now.

568
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,565
1, 2, 3, just like we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 here.

569
00:31:58,436 --> 00:32:00,600
Every set of quotation marks here is the row.

570
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,685
And then within this row, I'm creating different columns.

571
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,076
And for each one of these columns, I'm giving them a name.

572
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:07,925
And so let's hit save and...

573
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:09,250
Look at that.

574
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,492
Some magic happened.

575
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:12,035
But you'll notice it's not using

576
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:13,276
the area as well.

577
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:14,338
But here we can see I have 1, 1, 2, 5,

578
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:19,885
5 continues down here, 4 goes across these two, and 3 is here.

579
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:24,494
I'll even notice it puts these like solid red lines around the areas.

580
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:27,929
To highlight where they are in the visualization tools, whereas here like

581
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,957
between four and four, there's no solid red line.

582
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:33,263
So it tries to help us show us where things are.

583
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,571
So that just means we need to use these grid areas.

584
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,076
And again, is this more set up?

585
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:38,862
Yes, it definitely is more set up.

586
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:43,498
But I just find it works so well once you've taken the time to do this.

587
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:48,394
I'm going to use this because of the way the layout is with the nth child selector.

588
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:51,624
a lot of the time I'm doing this on a component that has like

589
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:55,992
You know, it might be your name, your name, your role, description and image.

590
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:57,995
So you can choose those selectors that you've.

591
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:01,209
already made in those classes and be applying all of that to those.

592
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:05,637
But what we'll do is we'll come here, we'll say, and I'll set this up really fast.

593
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:07,519
So we'll fast forward for a second.

594
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:15,366
Okay so I've set up my nth child selectors and each one is my testimony nth child so my first

595
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:18,424
child, second child, third child, fourth child, and my fifth child.

596
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,700
and then to place something on a grid area.

597
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:24,950
you just want to come in and say what grid area they should be living on.

598
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,557
So my first one should be living on grid area one.

599
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,079
And you'll notice here it's not in quotation marks.

600
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,435
And this is something I think gets some people caught off guard.

601
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,402
Here they're using one

602
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,528
Here we're setting everything in like a string type of thing.

603
00:33:37,588 --> 00:33:38,469
It's in quotation marks.

604
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:40,412
Here you don't use quotation marks.

605
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,114
just to be aware of that.

606
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:45,258
Then we can do a two and then we can use a three.

607
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,878
I mean put a four and then we can set a five here, hit save.

608
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:52,928
and my layout comes together.

609
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,477
There's one issue with it, but look at that.

610
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:55,281
It's come together.

611
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:58,969
And then we can shrink that down and it pops over and then comes back.

612
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:02,841
And what I really like about grid areas is check this out.

613
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:06,803
Let's take this guy, copy him and paste him.

614
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:09,909
And maybe we do this at 30 rem instead.

615
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:12,673
So we're going to create two different ones and we do one one

616
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:18,233
Let's do one one then we'll do a two five

617
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:19,440
a 3-5

618
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:25,455
And then a four five

619
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,962
Hit save and so now let's go all the way down.

620
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:31,746
They all stack on top of each other just like we had it

621
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,889
Then I come to here and I get my 1, 2, 5, 3, 5,

622
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,537
4.5 doesn't really work with this layout, but you can see it's going.

623
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:41,660
Or so maybe we do 4.4 then across the bottom.

624
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:42,806
And we get that.

625
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:43,352
There we go.

626
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:47,963
So we get this layout like that, and then we get to a larger layout, and then it goes that way.

627
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:53,352
and you can just change the layout how you need to at different screen sizes so easily.

628
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:57,120
And what I really love with this is I'm only worried about the parent.

629
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,904
I don't have to do anything on the children.

630
00:34:59,104 --> 00:34:59,965
This is the children.

631
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,608
I set the grid area they live on.

632
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,631
I never have to worry about it again.

633
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:05,293
which is just so magical.

634
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:09,680
And for this to be working at this stage, all I've done is display grid,

635
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:15,497
a gap and a grid template areas and then I'm just redefining the grid template areas for each one.

636
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:19,724
and with the visualization and seeing, oh, I have a grid area here, I have a grid area here.

637
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:23,700
I find this so easy and so simple to work this way.

638
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,469
and I don't even need spans because I'm saying that my one, let's go find him, my grid area one

639
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:33,761
You're living on grid area one and grid area one is going across

640
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:36,893
two different columns, so it's going to span those two columns.

641
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:37,876
It's wonderful.

642
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:42,226
Now you might have noticed we ran into that issue I talked about when I deleted my display

643
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:47,747
when I deleted the grid template columns that I'd originally set up with that repeat syntax,

644
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,973
where the columns are different sizes.

645
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:54,062
This one's really small and then this one's bigger just because of the way the content is distributed.

646
00:35:54,543 --> 00:36:00,313
and it's doing its automatic thing to make it work which is cool and maybe that's happy and maybe this is exactly what you need.

647
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:04,291
But if you do want to ensure that you have columns that are always the same size,

648
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,982
and you're not actually setting up any columns.

649
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:14,514
We can do this in one spot and then never have to worry about it, which is coming here and saying grid auto column.

650
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:14,968
Thanks for watching.

651
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:20,092
because these columns are automatically being generated based on my grid template areas.

652
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:24,450
So it's grid auto columns, and then you say what size you want them to be.

653
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,537
and that means any automatically generated column and you can do the same for rows.

654
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:32,434
Any automatically generated column will be a 1FR.

655
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:36,162
So if I hit save now each column is the same size.

656
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,067
We get nice even columns and the layout becomes a little bit more

657
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:43,333
And if you really like this grid template areas approach of working

658
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:49,183
but you want to see it with an example where I'm not using nth child and I'm actually doing it in a bit more realistic of a situation perhaps.

659
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:53,487
There's a video here for your viewing pleasure that you can check out where I dive a lot

660
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:59,055
deeper into that and with that a really big thank you to all of my patrons for their monthly support I can't do it without you guys and

661
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:02,918
And until next time, don't forget to make your corner of the internet just a little bit more awesome.
