1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:01,939
Alright poor people, I'm back.

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:02,663
That's right.

3
00:00:02,884 --> 00:00:07,804
Here to provide you my worldly wisdom on how to become successful and make some serious money out of it.

4
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:11,852
And the first thing to understand is whatever it is you're doing, just stop.

5
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:14,981
You may have noticed I've stopped.

6
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:19,842
doing anything productive over the past few months I haven't released a single video.

7
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:24,915
because I just realized that it's just totally pointless to try to do anything.

8
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:27,435
nowadays when the government is printing

9
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:30,978
Inflating massive amounts of money right like you're actually

10
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:33,735
trying to earn your dough and then the government is just printing...

11
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,426
billions, trillions of dollars out there just

12
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:39,537
making this money out of thin air to dilute your work.

13
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:40,761
They're just extracting.

14
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:42,268
all of your value.

15
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:43,272
So why even bother?

16
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:43,734
Why try?

17
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,950
It's a lot like being on the Titanic and then trying to...

18
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:52,011
study java while the ship is sinking or rearranging chairs doing your LeetCode and just stop.

19
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:53,837
It's over.

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:54,821
I know we

21
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,861
We all feel this need to try to be productive, work hard, hustle, grind.

22
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:03,255
were addicted to the pain, the struggle of putting in the hard work but

23
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,252
Sometimes you mistake motion for action.

24
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:10,606
And in this world of ADHD, the best thing you can do, the contrarian move,

25
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,049
is to just do nothing.

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,632
Just stop moving.

27
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,035
Can anybody just do that?

28
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:15,556
Hold still.

29
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:20,756
because the more you move the more energy you're going to waste and the faster you're going to die you're wasting your own resources

30
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:22,622
You're going to have to pay more for food.

31
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,770
So you may be wondering what's new.

32
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:26,192
Nothing.

33
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:28,118
Absolutely nothing is new.

34
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,035
around here, I've been sitting around doing nothing just staring at the blank screen all day.

35
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,394
because there's no work to do, really, except to just wait.

36
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:41,098
I'm waiting for Bitcoin to get to a million dollars actually because it's my only salvation around here.

37
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,587
is the only thing that can save me.

38
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:46,430
I've recognized that fact whereas you have not.

39
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,676
Many people have not.

40
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:50,892
and they're still out there pretending, trying to struggle.

41
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,707
Trying to do something just to keep themselves busy.

42
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:54,451
You can work.

43
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,386
or not, doesn't really matter, it's really optional.

44
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,316
It's not going to move the needle here though.

45
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:04,457
The most important thing when you're syncing on the Titanic ship is really your positioning.

46
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:08,533
You'll want to get to a life raft if at all possible because the whole ship is done.

47
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:13,794
And look, I get it, I've been gone for a while, and you may be under the impression that

48
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:18,721
I've just been slacking off around here with the lack of any new video content.

49
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:21,429
You may think that I've just been hiking the mountain.

50
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,108
Hawaiian islands, going on Mexican cruises, or exploring Japan like I am now.

51
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:29,018
and what I suppose you would be right.

52
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,480
but you would be highly mistaken to think that I'm

53
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:33,548
unproductive.

54
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,121
In fact, I've been more productive

55
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:40,282
than I've ever been in my whole entire life, more productive than most programmers certainly, what have I been doing?

56
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,247
I have been huddling, diamond handing.

57
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:46,493
which is an incredibly difficult skill because it requires

58
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:50,009
me to read news, reread news, and continue to convince myself

59
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,256
to just sit still and do nothing instead of

60
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,589
trading, buying, selling, getting in and out of positions.

61
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,336
Sometimes the best thing to do is to

62
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,320
just do nothing.

63
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,971
And yes, that is considered to work as well.

64
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:02,316
It's not about how hard you work,

65
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:03,681
about how smart you are.

66
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:05,026
Don't be addicted to your own

67
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:09,626
pain and suffering, it is not required and certainly not the prerequisite to success.

68
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:10,550
by any means.

69
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:13,782
In fact, the path to success is often fun and easy.

70
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:18,747
Have you ever noticed how everyone seems to tell you to work hard, grind harder,

71
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:23,169
put in the hours, wake up early, but nobody ever tells you what to actually

72
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,314
work on except to maybe go to the gym and somehow this is going to

73
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:29,178
and make you successful.

74
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:33,385
Because nobody knows what to actually do, there's nothing to do.

75
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:34,811
There's no actual work.

76
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,639
For anyone to do a round trip, what do you want me to do?

77
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,822
Build you a little app?

78
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:43,882
Some little stupid minigame, in-game monetization, microtransactions, you want me to make you a blog?

79
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:44,070
Good luck.

80
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,228
This idea of work was really a figment of the last era.

81
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,666
But hard work never equals success.

82
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,840
You see, I know you.

83
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,974
I understand you, you programmer tech bros out there.

84
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,403
disgusting know-it-all scumbags

85
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:02,268
We're the same.

86
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:03,960
Actually, we're not.

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,604
I'm way better.

88
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,797
The world is now flooded with computer science degrees.

89
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:08,701
Everyone's got one.

90
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:13,942
computer science graduates have tripled within the last decade and companies are now laying everybody off

91
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:18,159
because they just don't need these useless degrees anymore and what's really happened actually is...

92
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,733
We've moved on from the knowledge economy.

93
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,813
rationality, merit, science.

94
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:28,479
None of these things really matter anymore in today's era.

95
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,897
Actually, we're entering this post-science, late-stage capitalism era where

96
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,722
Mostly it's just about power, if you have power

97
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,342
then you get what you want and screw the science right ignore that

98
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:41,889
manipulate the data.

99
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:45,503
By now people have realized how to game the system in order to achieve the result.

100
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:46,527
that they desire.

101
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,503
And beyond that what's really happened is I believe we have reached peak

102
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,490
technology, actually.

103
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:56,881
We invented what is essentially digital drugs, digital opioids.

104
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,376
which is like short form video, TikToks.

105
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:02,278
And that has really obsoleted the need for

106
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,649
any future technological innovation.

107
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,420
People don't need anymore apps or games when they've become

108
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:10,934
What more do digital drug addicts need?

109
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:12,500
After all, they're totally content with

110
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,086
doing in front of their videos.

111
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,415
These short videos and TikToks really provide people with everything.

112
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:19,757
They tell them how to think,

113
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,181
what to do, where to go, what to buy.

114
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:26,800
And so what's happened is, even with something as innovative as Apple's Vision Pro,

115
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,414
VR goggles with all of that technology.

116
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:32,525
nobody even cares anymore because we

117
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:35,762
We've moved on past the knowledge economy, we are now in an...

118
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:38,763
attention economy were the number one skill.

119
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,451
is not STEM.

120
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,576
Nobody cares about STEM.

121
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,792
The number one skill is your ability to gain attention.

122
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,122
to draw attention in this world.

123
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:52,353
If you're able to do that, you'll be able to succeed in the new attention economy.

124
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:52,895
If you can't.

125
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:57,232
If all you know is some STEM degree, science or something, then you're going to fail.

126
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:57,875
Nobody cares.

127
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,503
that the science doesn't even matter nobody cares

128
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,370
about the science is totally fabricated.

129
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,477
Nobody believes any of the science or data or

130
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:08,437
any of their research papers, science has become a means of manipulation.

131
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:11,451
Just trust the science and yet there have even been recent reports of 11,000

132
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:15,330
peer-reviewed scientific papers being retracted.

133
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,601
as science has faced an existential crisis.

134
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:24,002
More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiment.

135
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,595
And if you want to truly understand the extent to which science is fabricated, you can check out

136
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,202
The Real Anthony Fauci by RFK Jr.

137
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:32,646
is this book that

138
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:37,093
actually claims the entire HIV industry was fabricated.

139
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:42,654
to fund Dr. Fauci's little political games and corporate interests in order to fund the money

140
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:45,162
to his friends what matters more in this world.

141
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:49,881
isn't the data but instead it's having some big influential celebrity

142
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:54,448
Voicing an opinion and whatever that opinion is becomes truth, it becomes fact

143
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,327
So that's why the little computer program you're working on out there, the little app or website or whatever

144
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:04,221
stupid in your coding is going to be totally ignored and nobody even cares.

145
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,698
You see, what people should do is just relax and sit back like me.

146
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,930
You could work, but you're going to get laid off one way or another.

147
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,064
another Tesla laying off another 7,000 people reportedly starting in June.

148
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,703
What these companies do is first they hire you.

149
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,564
And then they burn and churn, they threaten to fire you.

150
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:25,551
making work evenings and weekends, extracting maximum value, milking you for everything that you've got.

151
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:30,282
and then you get fired one way or another in the end and you lose the equity that you may have been building

152
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:31,167
that company.

153
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:33,560
They just say hey you know what we don't need you anymore sorry.

154
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:34,717
Bye.

155
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:35,359
Bye.

156
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,922
And the other thing I think...

157
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:41,303
these tech companies have realized is that with the COVID era and all of the remote work,

158
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:46,299
Companies realize that not only can they do remote work, but that they can actually just outsource

159
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,278
all workers all together to third world countries where people are cheaper and people work harder.

160
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,506
Americans especially can't compete.

161
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,372
to hire Americans anymore.

162
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,377
The American workforce is expensive.

163
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,462
self-entitled, lazy, fat, quite literally.

164
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,535
and they tend to be social activists.

165
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:03,542
Who wants that on their team?

166
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,582
I suppose if you're truly foolish, you could even go to...

167
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:09,070
college and get yourself into massive student debt.

168
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,507
and then try to dig yourself out of that debt through decades of wage slavery in a 95-cubicle

169
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:18,939
And maybe, just maybe you might break even or even turn a small profit.

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,999
before you find yourself old and withered away from a sedentary lifestyle.

171
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,877
may be sick and diseased and having your savings

172
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:29,945
destroyed with runaway inflation and ultimately discarded and replaced by

173
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:35,188
AI or outsourced workers as companies burn and churn through their employees.

174
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,003
I think there's just no more opportunity.

175
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,154
in the traditional 9-5 world.

176
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:40,918
And so that's why

177
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:44,290
I've decided to just entirely stop trying to be productive.

178
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:47,944
in late stage capitalism, which is where

179
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:51,866
we're at now, there is no actual productivity left anymore.

180
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:56,015
It's a zero-sum game and there's only one way left for anybody to make

181
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,794
money around here and this good old-fashioned classic and this is my favorite scamming

182
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:05,549
And so we have fees, convenience fees, tips, tips upon tips.

183
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,351
20% tips, 30% tips.

184
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:07,393
Hey, just give more.

185
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:13,329
In Venting Wars, there are GoFundMes and charity donations for

186
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,424
fake diseases like people pretending they have cancer.

187
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:17,811
Dark patterns everywhere.

188
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,865
Notice how every single iPad app is a monthly recurring subscription.

189
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,478
There are credit card fees everywhere, speeding tickets.

190
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,151
for even going 5 mph over their speed limit.

191
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,333
actually protecting the roads but not making anyone safer.

192
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:32,808
It's just there to collect money for the government.

193
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:34,055
That's what they're doing out there.

194
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:38,845
Taxes going up without any apparent upgrades to any of the infrastructure you've got home

195
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:43,243
hospital bill scams, insurance bill scams, HOA housing bill scams.

196
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:47,538
Like with the HOA, sometimes you're paying thousands of dollars and there's no service.

197
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,435
There's not even a yard, there's no amenities, nothing at all.

198
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,200
What is this HOA fee for?

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,524
Oh yeah right, they're scamming you.

200
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,011
And you have to remember all of this is because

201
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:59,661
where in a stagnant economy, there is zero productivity.

202
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:04,781
whatever you're doing out there for your line of work, just gotta keep in mind, it's not productive.

203
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:07,329
And if you want more proof that there's just no

204
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,084
No more work to be done and we have reached a stage of zero productivity.

205
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:12,168
Just look at Apple.

206
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:17,068
which is completely one of the largest buybacks in history where they had so much excessive cash.

207
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,108
They didn't know what to do with the money, they couldn't find anything worth investing in.

208
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,498
nothing worth research and development in.

209
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:26,510
They didn't need to hire anybody, they just took that money and bought back

210
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:27,333
their own stock.

211
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:30,183
And I'll tell you what they probably should have done with that excess cash is

212
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:31,790
just buy some bitcoin with it.

213
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,304
There was another company, some medical company, similar scientific which

214
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,360
They took their cash reserves, put into Bitcoin, their stock went up 28% right away.

215
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,812
When we take a look at the overall tech landscape,

216
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:46,784
the metaverse failed, web 3 failed, you know these could have been

217
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,262
entire massive revolutionary industries that would have employed

218
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:54,672
Huge swaths of Americans out there, the whole industry was shut down by regulation.

219
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,722
And so after that, we were eventually thrown back into

220
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,259
the web 2.0 era, a blast from the past of mobile apps

221
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:03,647
over-saturated, tired old apps.

222
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:08,145
And there's just no more opportunity there, not only are consumers tired of these apps

223
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:12,337
vegetating on videos already, but all of the APIs and data.

224
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:17,440
that these third-party apps would traditionally have relied on in order to provide services are now being

225
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,328
shut down and blocked off for AI.

226
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:23,491
No company wants to release their AI data anymore to anybody

227
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:28,405
And so nowadays, almost every single API is shut down and siloed off from one another.

228
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:33,385
to prevent the AI data scraping, thus incapacitating most third-party apps in the process.

229
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:36,773
Now some people are going to say, well, there's AI at least, right?

230
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:41,201
There was a recent tweet by Meta's chief AI scientist who said, don't work on LLM.

231
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,767
This is in the hands of large companies.

232
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,292
There's nothing you can bring to the table.

233
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:50,553
Maybe instead you should work on some other next-gen AI system that lifts some limitation of LLM

234
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:53,302
So I guess there's some opportunities.

235
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:56,582
opportunity there if you think you can bring about the next revolution of AI.

236
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:58,652
Maybe get a PhD in that first.

237
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,810
Another major headwind in tech worth mentioning has been de-globalization.

238
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:07,916
where the world is starting to split into separate factions.

239
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,993
Whereas in the past, tech companies had global reach.

240
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:16,023
Today, most tech companies have had their reach actively being blocked by other countries.

241
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,440
Russia, China, the BRICS nations have raised their own digital

242
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:22,500
firewalls, tech companies are just not as profitable.

243
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,010
as they used to be as they're now becoming domestic local companies.

244
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,882
In conclusion, some errors are just bad.

245
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,688
Sometimes you just can't make money.

246
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:32,452
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

247
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:33,577
Tech is done.

248
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:34,964
The STEM degree is done.

249
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,009
Merit is done.

250
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:40,732
where nowadays working is like swimming upstream against the inflation and printing machine.

251
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,634
I recently read the Bitcoin standard and what I came to realize is that

252
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,740
when the US came off the gold standard in 1971.

253
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,102
It was quite the devious move actually where I threw that.

254
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:55,473
They unlock the full value of the US GDP and household economy.

255
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,477
for taxation purposes.

256
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,403
So whereas in the past all they could do was raise taxes but

257
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,788
your personal property would always have value.

258
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:03,871
It was backed by a goat.

259
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:08,597
Now they could just print and inflate all of the US GDP value away.

260
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,925
And so now we are paying off our debt by issuing more debt.

261
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:12,627
with the U.S.

262
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:16,704
national debt rising by $1 trillion every 100 days in some death cycle.

263
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:19,852
So given that, how do we succeed in this world?

264
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:22,341
Well, first off, if you're working some 9 to 5 wage slavery.

265
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,451
job maybe you should just stop it's a total waste of your life but I have three

266
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:27,695
suggestions.

267
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:29,642
Number one is entrepreneurship.

268
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:34,871
Now of course you're going to say, well not everyone can be an entrepreneur or you weren't all made to be one, but you know what?

269
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,099
People said the same thing about programmers as well.

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,826
Everyone can be a programmer, and yet nowadays, everyone's a programmer.

271
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,008
We just adapted to that.

272
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,091
And so in the future, everyone may have to become an entrepreneur as well.

273
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:50,908
You know, we're not talking about some like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos caliber entrepreneur, but

274
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,438
Even small business owners, hustlers, grifters,

275
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,497
blue collar workers like gardeners, handymen, dog walkers, they all qualify as entrepreneurs.

276
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:02,225
actually and many of them make more than some software engineer.

277
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:07,606
especially the laid off ones, and they're probably under less stress and have more free time as well.

278
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:12,345
Now this may be difficult especially for those who have spent the majority of their childhood

279
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:16,794
to be some 9-5 wage slave indoctrinated into the school education system.

280
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:21,338
And even more weirdly, many of these people, perhaps including you yourself,

281
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,390
still aspire to be some top tier wage slave.

282
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:28,786
climbing that corporate ladder in order to achieve some fancy title or that corner office

283
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:33,786
wear that suit, but you've just got to give that dream up if you want to succeed in the new world.

284
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,536
The second consideration is we're no longer in

285
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,023
knowledge economy or anything science-based.

286
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,089
We are in an attention economy.

287
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,333
media-based.

288
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,999
Most apps these days have already

289
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,667
been replaced by influencers, content, video.

290
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,998
And I'll tell you something, AI is not going to succeed as well in my opinion.

291
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,898
in the world of influencers because fundamentally there's no right or wrong answer.

292
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:58,089
we don't live in an objective world and so the right answer

293
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,247
is whatever your favorite influencer or content creator tells you is the right answer.

294
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,524
Whatever they tell you to buy, how to live, how to think, that is what you will listen to.

295
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:07,548
You're not going to listen to ChatGPT.

296
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:12,568
I mean, when you think about it, nobody even pays for ChatGPT Premium, they're starting to give that stuff away.

297
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:13,301
stuff out for free.

298
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:17,623
And then the last suggestion, consider taking up a job as a Bitcoiner.

299
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:23,166
Hey, it's not easy and it's not for everyone to dime in hand and huddle all day long and it can be pretty tiring.

300
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:27,160
and tough boring work, but it turns out the more you study Bitcoin,

301
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:32,602
The more serious you become at it, the more you're willing to hold, and the higher your profits will be too.

302
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,047
or your losses.

303
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:34,770
All right.

304
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,438
Anyways, I gotta get back to work.

305
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,745
Got some more huddling to do.

306
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:38,972
See you in the next one.
