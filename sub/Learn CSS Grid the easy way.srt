1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
a

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,660
job done for you.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,440
Why bother with grid.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,460
Grid can do things that flexbox can't and I think actually if you simplify grid down

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,120
and start using it in very simple ways.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,780
It can actually be easier to use and learn

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,200
than Flexbox can, and that's why I want to look at

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,420
how we can simplify Grid,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,500
and look at the easy ways to get working with it,

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,260
and we're going to be doing that in this video.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,720
Hello, my friend and friends,

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,300
and welcome back to yet another video.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm so glad that you've come to join me once again.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,720
And if you're new here, my name is Kevin

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,280
and here at my channel, I hope you fall,

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,320
madly, deeply in love with 2020 CSS.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,940
And if not, fall in love with it.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,820
I hope to at least make you a little bit less

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,080
frustrated with it.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,580
And today we're doing that by exploring a topic

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,400
that is one of my favorite things to use with CSS,

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,860
which is CSS Grid.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,740
In simplifying grid, I actually think there's different ways

24
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,260
that we can simplify it, so I'm gonna be breaking this down

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,860
and we're gonna be examining this layout

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,220
with two different approaches.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,680
So one of them is going to be more of like

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
a natural starting point, I think, for grid

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,420
and just understanding the very basics

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,640
of how we can simplify Grid to get the layout

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,180
that we want it to make for us.

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,060
And then the other approach we're gonna sort of

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,720
scrap what we did and take another way

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,380
that I really like to work today,

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,660
and what I'd really encourage you to do

36
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,620
is watch both of them,

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,660
and see which one speaks to you a little bit more.

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,240
Some are more practical for some layouts,

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,940
some are more practical for other layouts,

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,340
but for both of them,

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
I think they're very nice,

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,640
simple ways to approach things.

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,260
And none of it's going to sync in,

44
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,500
you might watch both of them and go,

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,520
they both make a lot of sense.

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,180
Grid is easy,

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,140
and then try to use it,

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,960
and you might get stuck.

49
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,180
Make sure when you're learning something like this

50
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
that you're practicing it.

51
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,700
But as much as possible

52
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,580
I'm trying to eliminate some properties,

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,460
some things that we don't need to be using

54
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,060
because there's so many out there for grid,

55
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,180
I want to focus on the ones that we do need

56
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,280
to really understand it and on the ones

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
that we can use to simplify our life,

58
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,980
especially with media queries and other things.

59
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,060
All right, so for this one,

60
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm actually building out this layout

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,660
that you can see here, which is in Figma right now,

62
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,080
but this is from Front-end Mentor

63
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,740
and I'm doing it

64
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,340
just because I was trying to find a nice layout

65
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,980
that we could build that would require grid

66
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,760
and this looks pretty gritty to me.

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,540
So we're going to use this as our example,

68
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,560
but what I've actually done

69
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,720
is I've actually done quite a bit of work already

70
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,040
in getting things styled,

71
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,280
but I haven't applied anything to do with Grid yet at all.

72
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,220
Now if you'd like to follow along,

73
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,380
the GitHub repo for this is linked down below

74
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,360
and I've included the starting CSS.

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,720
So exactly what I have here

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,940
and this style.css will be the finished version of it.

77
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,340
So if you want to follow along

78
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,380
or play with what I have to start with

79
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,340
you can do just that.

80
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,060
Let's jump in there.

81
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,460
Here I have my testimonial grid

82
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,000
and actually, let's just go take a quick look at my markup.

83
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,600
And so basically, I have my main here

84
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,160
which I set as my testimonial grid.

85
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,920
And then inside my Main,

86
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,140
I've just put each one of these card type things

87
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,640
as its own article, with a class of text of testimonial

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,080
and a few other utility classes and things on there

89
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,860
that aren't too important.

90
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,140
But what's really important

91
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,580
is that these the direct children,

92
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,960
these articles right here.

93
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,520
And so what I'm gonna do is come over to my style

94
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,900
where we have my testimonial grid.

95
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,580
And I think we know what we wanna do.

96
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,160
I have the first thing to start with Grid

97
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,720
is we do need a display of Grid.

98
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,220
And I won't tell you how many times

99
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,760
I've actually forgotten to do that.

100
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,280
And when you do display grid, generally speaking,

101
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,540
nothing will really change.

102
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,380
And this is actually one of the things I like about grid

103
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,960
compared to Flexbox, Flexbox will work.

104
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,960
It gives you the columns,

105
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,560
but sometimes those columns don't do

106
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
what you want them to do

107
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,940
and you have to finick around a little bit

108
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,840
and get things to, you know,

109
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,160
it can be a little bit strange

110
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,780
if it doesn't do exactly what you want it to early on.

111
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,100
Whereas with grid,

112
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,360
you do display grid, generally not much changes.

113
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
Sometimes if you had did it and there's paragraphs,

114
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,940
all of a sudden things might become double spaced

115
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,660
because with grid and with FlexX,

116
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,260
the direct children, so the grid items

117
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,620
or the flex items no longer have collapsing margins.

118
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,720
So that can be a little thing that can get in your way

119
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,360
but we have no margins between these

120
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
so absolutely nothing changes

121
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,120
but we do need some spacing between them.

122
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,700
And this is where people will sometimes use margin

123
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,520
to create spacing or of course we have gap

124
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,780
and I'm going to recommend gap 100% of the time

125
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,400
because we need vertical spacing

126
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,900
and we need horizontal spacing.

127
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,120
Vertical spacing and horizontal spacing

128
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,340
I always get those backwards.

129
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,120
If you've been following for a while, you know that.

130
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,040
And because we want this spacing to all be equal everywhere

131
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,500
Gap makes a lot of sense.

132
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,760
But in general with the Gap property,

133
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,280
by doing it we don't get gaps on the outside

134
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,760
of any elements and things like that.

135
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,020
Like if you wanted to add margins

136
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,500
through a grid system of any kind,

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,780
it gets a little bit annoying

138
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,720
even if it's just columns going across

139
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,820
and you don't even have rows

140
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,560
I'd always always always recommend Gap now

141
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,280
and margins I'm using less and less and less

142
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,540
for little spacing things.

143
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,240
So let's come in,

144
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
I think it's a 1.5 rim.

145
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,440
maybe it's it too, that looks pretty good. So I'll stick with that, and we're started! We have a grid

146
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,280
and we have my gap and one of the first things I'm going to say is if you are working with grid,

147
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,240
make sure that you use your dev tools. So I am going to open those and in my dev tools,

148
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm going to be bringing them off screen just so it doesn't take up too much room.

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,720
But what I'm going to do – I'm in the accessibility tab, let's go and just go to my inspector,

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,180
Here, I have this grid on here,

151
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,140
and it's a little toggle.

152
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,680
I am in Firefox and I like Firefoxes,

153
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,820
especially for demos because things are much bigger

154
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,840
and easier to see.

155
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,580
And we're going to be looking at our line numbers

156
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,440
and a few other things.

157
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,380
Chrome has all of these things too,

158
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,300
it has the area names, it has line numbers

159
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,100
and these visualizations.

160
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,680
So whichever browser you're in,

161
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,760
it works almost exactly the same.

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,520
You can see your grid,

163
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,580
you can change the color of the grid.

164
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,040
So actually let's go to a darker color

165
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,420
just so we can see it a bit better.

166
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,460
may be something like that just wait it's something that pops or will read but something

167
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:48,320
that pops a bit on our layout and again you can do that chrome or firefox and safari actually

168
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,320
there's safari's new chrome inspector is really really good you can even there's some scrolling

169
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,600
issue sometimes you might get with overlaying grids and stuff safari's new one is surprisingly

170
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,640
powerful and good that's what happens when jen simmons is on the team um so we have display

171
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,500
And so with a grid that's there,

172
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,540
we can see my gaps that are coming in now,

173
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,460
and, but we, of courseoup need some columns.

174
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,920
And, this is the first thing I'm gonna say,

175
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,900
if you are setting up a grid

176
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,320
and you're not really comfortable with using grids,

177
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,000
one of the hardest things to know

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
is how many columns you might need?

179
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,660
So I'm actually gonna come on here

180
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,260
and I'm gonna grab my pen tool,

181
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,820
not my pen tool, my pencil tool,

182
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,020
which I don't know the shortcut of because I never use it.

183
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,420
We're gonna pull that open and I always, always recommend,

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
and we can't see it cause there we go.

185
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,860
We can see it now.

186
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,700
Figma chooses the color of it based on the background

187
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,060
and I was drawing on the purple so I chose a white pencil.

188
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,440
So there's the container that I'm inside,

189
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,240
that's my main grid,

190
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,340
and then I clearly need to have something that goes here

191
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,440
but that does need to come into this area here,

192
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,740
so let's highlight that in white too,

193
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,380
so that line continues here.

194
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,340
Here's the nice easy one that goes all the way down,

195
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,940
like that,

196
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,820
but look, we're looking up here,

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,460
you might go I need a big one, a small one,

198
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,280
and a small one but don't forget over here,

199
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,300
this gets split too.

200
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,900
So I need to split this one across like that as well

201
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,280
This is where it can really help you visualize

202
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,600
how many rows and how many columns you actually need because when you're looking at a design sometimes you miss things and

203
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,580
Sometimes you need three rows instead of two or six rows instead of three depending on what you need to do

204
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,240
Even now I get tripped up sometimes

205
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,160
And I eventually get it if I'm not drawing on top of it and this takes

206
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,860
Three seconds to do and then it just makes it a lot easier. So I know I need 1 2 3 4 columns

207
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,020
I also need to have two rows, but I'm not going to declare them

208
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm going to talk more about that soon, but I'm only going to declare my columns for now. So I'm gonna say grid

209
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,180
Template columns which is how we can declare our columns because we're setting up our template

210
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,480
so it's the template columns that the items will live on so grid template columns and

211
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,800
There's one unit if you're new to grid. We'll go slowly with this

212
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,000
So here I'm just gonna make this a bit bigger to give myself a bit more room

213
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
So we can see everything that I'm gonna write.

214
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,920
And grid template columns,

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,940
we have to say what they're gonna be.

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
So you could come in here and say,

217
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,920
I have a hundred pixels.

218
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,580
And I'm just gonna do one and hit save.

219
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,060
And now I have one column that's a hundred pixels.

220
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,960
And then I could just put a space and do 100 pixels.

221
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,220
And now I have two columns.

222
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,440
And then I could say pixels and have three columns.

223
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,320
Cool.

224
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,460
That works really well.

225
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Another one you can do is come in with percentages,

226
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,200
25%, 25 and 25%.

227
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880
And okay, so that's working and it might look like it's not working

228
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,000
But it's cos it's hiding so there we go

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,360
we have three columns going all the way across that way and

230
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,340
One thing we want to do is actually divide this space up equally

231
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,860
So one we keep one way we can do that is with the Fr unit

232
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,540
So one Fr. This is my new grid only I would say new because it's been around for a while

233
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,740
But it's a grid only unit

234
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,760
which is like it sort of uses the flexbox algorithm from what I understand of it and

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,780
It's basically a fraction. So one fraction one fraction one fraction

236
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,260
So we're saying divide all of those up equally now, you can do more with fr's than this

237
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,520
But I find most of the time you just want nice even columns

238
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,260
And so this is a really nice way to get it to say each one is getting an equal amount of space

239
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,660
There is more complexity to how this works, but we're not going to dive into that

240
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,720
We want to keep things simple and almost every time you use it

241
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,740
That's going to be the result that you get is three equal columns

242
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,720
Or if you did five you get five equal columns

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
So on and so forth now

244
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm gonna make this guy a little bigger again because

245
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,140
What happens with grid is sometimes you end up doing that or I just said five so you end up actually putting in five and

246
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,020
Then when you want like to change this

247
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,740
It's a little frustrating or even typing it out whenever I went to fire went to fire

248
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,480
It's kind of annoying and they realized a lot of the time we're gonna want equal for all of them

249
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,800
so that's where we have the repeat function that we can use and

250
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
In repeat you say how many times you want to repeat it?

251
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,300
Put a comma and then say what you want to do

252
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,380
So let's put a hundred pixels again

253
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,440
just so we can see that working.

254
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,580
And so it's repeated three columns at a hundred pixels,

255
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,680
but of course I don't want a hundred pixels.

256
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,900
We saw that a four works.

257
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,440
So I can just say three and one fr

258
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,100
and that gives me three columns

259
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,380
that are one ifr each.

260
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,740
Except of course I just said this to three.

261
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,600
But just thinking back,

262
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,960
we actually want that to be four right?

263
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,040
There we go.

264
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,820
Because again, why is it four?

265
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,420
Let's go look we have one, two, three, four columns

266
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,560
on my layer, not three.

267
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,600
That was a little silly me.

268
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,440
There we go.

269
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,800
So we get my four columns going across

270
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
And you'll notice I haven't set any rows yet.

271
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,020
And actually four now, let's bring this back to three

272
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,380
because it looks a little nicer for the moment.

273
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,160
And we'll go back to four in a second.

274
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
And I just wanna talk a little bit

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,100
about setting grid templates rows.

276
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,200
Because I think this is one of those places

277
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,080
where people add complexity that they don't need to add.

278
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,840
Because notice if I say there's three columns,

279
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,700
my content, if I have more than three,

280
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,280
so when I have more than three children in here,

281
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,180
like these articles, if I have more than three of them,

282
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,320
they just go Oh, I got to the third column,

283
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,220
There's no more columns in this. I'm gonna create a row and come down here. And this is where you might hear the terms

284
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,120
Implicit and explicit grid. So this is where I've explicitly declared three columns. So I've said there are three columns

285
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,300
I haven't said how many rows there are

286
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,060
so the grid is creating new rows for me as it needs to and these are

287
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,640
Implicit rows because it's just going there's content here that needs somewhere to live

288
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,460
I'm gonna make that space automatically without you telling me to do that and

289
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,740
and as much with the web in general,

290
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,600
we're so used to like items, you know,

291
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,880
the auto height where it just grows by itself.

292
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,680
We place new items,

293
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,580
they stack on top of each other by default.

294
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,060
We're very used to that idea of new things

295
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,280
just sort of coming in and going

296
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,320
where they should go automatically.

297
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
So when I can, I try not to declare grid template rows.

298
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,380
I will declare it when I need to,

299
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,760
when I very specific grids

300
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,540
where I'm trying to do very specific things

301
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,480
that need a bit of finicking around

302
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,500
and a bit of finessing

303
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,480
and a little bit of other stuff going on.

304
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,500
But for the most part,

305
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,900
you can get away with grid template rows

306
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,020
and not declaring grid template columns.

307
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,300
And if that's the case,

308
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,540
I strongly recommend that you do that.

309
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,600
Because it just gives you a lot less overhead

310
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,840
and a lot less to think about when you're making it,

311
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,880
just because you just have to worry about your rows

312
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,840
and everything just sort of falls into place from there.

313
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,920
And what I'm doing here with these explicit columns

314
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,820
as I'm saying, also how big they have to be?

315
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,600
Whereas with those rows that it's implacently creating

316
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,260
or these automatically created rows,

317
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,080
it's just doing what it needs to do.

318
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,320
It's matching the height of the tallest one,

319
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,800
basically, that's a lot like how Flexbox works.

320
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,100
If you do display flex,

321
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,700
they just all match the height of the tallest item.

322
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,440
You can change this behavior

323
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,820
and you can get control on your auto rows

324
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,000
or auto columns if you fall into that world.

325
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,880
But we want to keep things simple for now.

326
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,220
So I'm not gonna get into that,

327
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,380
but it is a possibility,

328
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,420
but let's keep things as simple as we can.

329
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,620
So every time you're gonna do a display grid,

330
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,560
you'll probably wanna set a gap on there.

331
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,600
and then you're going to set up some columns.

332
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,280
Then if you need to, start worrying about more.

333
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,360
But, we're not going to do that.

334
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,480
Let's fix this.

335
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,360
We go back up to four.

336
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,820
And let's start trying to get this layout

337
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,860
to work for us a little bit.

338
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,740
And so let's go look back at our layout.

339
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,160
And we have this one here,

340
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
and this one here,

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,740
that need to span across two columns each.

342
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,460
So let's go and create something

343
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,680
that can allow us to do that.

344
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,260
And what I really like for this type of thing,

345
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,260
instead of trying to find like a class,

346
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,700
a specific class for each one of those

347
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
and writing it twice,

348
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm going to come here,

349
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,460
And I'm just going to write, a dollarspan2.

350
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,020
and I could call this just span2,

351
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
I guess, if I wanted to.

352
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,900
I just like being really explicit

353
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,200
this class should be used with grid.

354
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,200
So I start with grid.

355
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,840
It's a sort of a little naming convention,

356
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,400
but you can name it however you want.

357
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,720
You might be saying, well there's no other way to span.

358
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,320
There is the multi-column-layout

359
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,160
that actually does have spans

360
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,320
and it did before grid even existed, I believe.

361
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,480
But, and it's a little bit different in how that works.

362
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,960
what we're going to do is say my grid column and even here this I guess this

363
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,800
could be grid call, call span two just in case you end up with row span two. So

364
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,940
let's do that grid call span two and so my grid column will be you only guess

365
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:59,140
span two isn't that so easy? Grid column is a shorthand property and we're going

366
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,920
to explore that a little bit more shortly but one nice thing is when you

367
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,860
just need to throw spans on staff it just works it doesn't matter that it's a

368
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,280
and shortly after that shorthand,

369
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,700
it puts it sort of where it should go

370
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,000
because you could actually put the span

371
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,660
on the start or the end.

372
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,040
Anyway, that's going to work.

373
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm gonna hit save.

374
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,280
So it's here, and we'll go over to my HTML.

375
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,660
And we're gonna add that into spots

376
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,500
where you need it on my first one.

377
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
So this is my first article.

378
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,480
Grid, call, span two.

379
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,440
If you're saying that's a long class name,

380
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,700
it is, but that's okay.

381
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,320
I like longer class names

382
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,200
if they really explain to me what they're doing.

383
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,880
That's fine.

384
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,600
I don't want like a GC S2 or something,

385
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,180
cause then I'll never remember that

386
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,560
and I'll never really know what it's for

387
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,700
or if somebody else comes to my code, they don't know.

388
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,560
Whereas this, it's very explicit.

389
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
If somebody were to come across this they see it.

390
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,060
There's a grid and they see

391
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,800
these are grid columns span two, it's a super clear.

392
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,560
So I like clear class names

393
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,140
that explain exactly what they're doing.

394
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,740
So let's hit safe here and see.

395
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,620
Wow, look at that.

396
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,900
Now there's some weird funkiness coming up over here

397
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,460
because this one is now so long

398
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,880
and it's mucking this up

399
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,860
because remember they're stretching

400
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,680
to try and match each other's heights.

401
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,380
But that's okay.

402
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,220
We made some nice progress.

403
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,160
Where the real issue is actually coming from

404
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
is this one is in the wrong spot,

405
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,600
but I put it there on purpose.

406
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,500
And not on purpose

407
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,620
because of, it would actually make more sense

408
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,680
if this was one, two, three,

409
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,020
whoops, let's get that in black,

410
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,380
three, four, five, right?

411
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Cause then that would be the order I see them in here.

412
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,140
The thing is, in this Figma design,

413
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,580
we have a mobile layout too.

414
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,520
And Janet is the third one.

415
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,200
That's the third one here.

416
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,560
I like working mobile first,

417
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,520
we're going to talk about the media queries in a second though,

418
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,480
but right now we need to get this one over here

419
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,280
or Ciara over here, one or the other,

420
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,700
and to do that there's lots of different approaches

421
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,780
and different ways we could do something like that.

422
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,420
This is where for me, utility classes don't quite work

423
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,780
just because you're placing things in very specific spots

424
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,840
or moving things around.

425
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,420
I just find it easier to actually target the class

426
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,260
that I want to work on.

427
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,200
And I could actually just give this specific one a class

428
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
and target it.

429
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,500
Cause if I look here, it's all very generic.

430
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,220
My classes, I have testimonial, the background colors

431
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,600
and a few other things going on there

432
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
but it's all very generic classes to style this up.

433
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,440
So there's different ways of selecting it.

434
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,620
Just for simplicity sake

435
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,060
and not wondering about creating a class for it.

436
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,580
I am going to use the nth child selector

437
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,920
or alters the last child selector, I guess,

438
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,500
just because it's gonna be faster for now.

439
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,000
If you wanted to make this a little bit more plug and play,

440
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,140
you could then actually give them very specific

441
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,780
classes that could make this work,

442
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,860
and but this is my test.

443
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,940
It is a testimonial, so we're gonna say

444
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,260
testimonial last child.

445
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,440
And because that's gonna select the last child,

446
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,640
let's say background red important,

447
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,500
just to see, there you go.

448
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,380
We can see that it's actually selecting the one

449
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,500
that we wanted to select,

450
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,660
So let's get rid of that.

451
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
And now we can get a little bit more

452
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,380
about placing items on the grid

453
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,240
when they're not going where you want them to go.

454
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,140
And this is where Line Numbers really come in.

455
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,580
And I've had my Grid Overlay on this entire time.

456
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,240
It's really important when you're using your Grid Overlay,

457
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,400
which has changed colors on me,

458
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,160
this happens sometimes when things refresh

459
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,120
even though it's still set to red here.

460
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,440
Just because it makes it a bit easier

461
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,380
to see on top of the purple.

462
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,660
I'll change that back to red.

463
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,400
But even if you're not working with it on all the time,

464
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,560
If you're gonna touch your line numbers,

465
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,260
I highly highly highly recommend

466
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,420
that you go ahead and have this on

467
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,220
because seeing the line numbers

468
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,440
makes it so much easier to work with.

469
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,580
And so I want it to be on my column four

470
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,980
to my column five.

471
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,440
And we want it from,

472
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,100
let's go look actually at the figma design.

473
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,260
I want it to be from the top here

474
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,780
and go all the way down to the bottom on this side.

475
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
So to be able to do that,

476
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,260
let's start with the column,

477
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,380
So we're gonna get this in the right spot. So we saw the grid column

478
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,360
Property before so I'm saying before we said span to so let's just do that for fun span to just to see that

479
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,820
Oops, we need that and it works it goes across the two like that

480
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,320
But in this case, I don't want to be doing a span to actually want to say start at line number four

481
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,160
So we can actually just put in grid column four and it will start at the line four and it leaves this one empty

482
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
why is it doing that?

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,460
What's happening?

484
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,560
So, grid column as I mentioned is a shorthand

485
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,680
and the shorthand is for grid column start

486
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
and my grid column end

487
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,280
and basically if I just do a grid column like that four,

488
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,540
it's just putting it as a grid column start

489
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,760
and it's not putting a grid column end

490
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,940
just because it doesn't even need to do that

491
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,500
we don't really need a grid column end

492
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,200
but just for fun, I could put three here

493
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,660
and we could say that the grid,

494
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,460
let's do a start, grid-column start is at three

495
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,740
and grid-column end is at five

496
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,200
and we get the same idea as the span two.

497
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,100
The reason I prefer span two when I can use it

498
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,300
is because here the span two class is working for this one

499
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,400
and it's working for this one over here.

500
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,940
It doesn't matter where they are

501
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,660
and even we're gonna end up movie this one over in a minute

502
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,300
and it doesn't matter where they are

503
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,380
or where they're lining up.

504
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,880
Span two is just saying it doesn't matter where you start

505
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,740
but the end,

506
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,680
And we just wanna make sure

507
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,240
we're spanning across two columns.

508
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,920
So this one's a little bit more versatile

509
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,600
than locking in with specific line numbers.

510
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,920
And just like before I said,

511
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,260
don't create rows unless you need to create rows.

512
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,820
Don't start using line numbers

513
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,420
unless you need to use line numbers.

514
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,180
Start as simple as possible

515
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,420
and add the complexity as you need to

516
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,840
to be able to get the layout that you need.

517
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,660
So first display grid, then my gap,

518
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,240
then I set up my columns.

519
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,000
Then I go, Oh, I need a few of these to span.

520
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,980
So I make a very general generic way to span columns.

521
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,340
I'm not saying you're going

522
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,920
from 1 to 3, and then oh, you're going to from 2 to 4, whatever, we need to get that

523
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,240
one to.

524
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,060
We actually, in this case, we can get rid of the end, because I don't need to worry

525
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,580
about that, but we need it to start at 4.

526
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,500
So we need it to be here, but I also need it to move up.

527
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,840
I need it starting at the top.

528
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,060
So I'm going to come here, and then this is when I'm finally going to worry about my row.

529
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,520
So we can do grid row, and we can do start on here.

530
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,040
And where do we want it to start?

531
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,480
At the top, at 1.

532
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,860
Oh my goodness!

533
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,400
It's all coming together so quickly.

534
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,260
now what happened?

535
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,160
Why did everything just fall into place?

536
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,860
Again, start simple,

537
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,860
start moving things

538
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,840
and all of a sudden your layout

539
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,180
might come together more than you think.

540
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,040
And so by saying grid rows start one.

541
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,620
Let's take this one off.

542
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,340
It's going in the order of the DOM.

543
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,160
So this is the,

544
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,100
you know what, let's choose the third one here.

545
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,460
Testimonial,

546
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,700
and child three,

547
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,880
the sky, background, red, important.

548
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,940
I just want to highlight

549
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,720
this is my third one in my dom.

550
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,220
So it's one, two, three.

551
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,480
The third one is going here

552
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,740
because that's just following the natural flow

553
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,760
that the items will go in.

554
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,380
First column, second column, third column,

555
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,160
it just goes and it goes,

556
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,780
oh, we're out of room, I'm gonna go down.

557
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,580
I'm gonna go to where this guy is.

558
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,520
And then we get that one

559
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,120
and then it sort of moves across from there.

560
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,120
As soon as I do grid row start one,

561
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,460
I'm saying, I need you, your grid column start is four,

562
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,220
so you're living in this box,

563
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,080
but I also need you to start at line number one,

564
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,320
which is the very top.

565
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,620
So as soon as I do that and I save that,

566
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,300
it has to live here, which means this one can't live there.

567
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,900
So it pushes down into the next empty cell

568
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,540
that it can find, and it just automatically goes there.

569
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,700
Even though this is the third one in the DOM,

570
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,940
it's grid-smart, and you can overlap.

571
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,620
Actually overlapping content with grid

572
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,820
is just, it's wonderful, but it won't do it by default.

573
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,220
You have to work at it a little bit

574
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,640
to actually get things to overlap.

575
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,160
So that gets pushed up, this falls down over here

576
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,900
because that's the next empty cell

577
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,940
that was available to it.

578
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,300
So awesome.

579
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,920
And I guess we can turn that red off now.

580
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,620
We don't need that.

581
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,680
And the last thing is we need this

582
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,260
to fill up all that space

583
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,400
and these are stretching, they look really ugly,

584
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,880
but as soon as this is allowed to stretch,

585
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,060
it should fix that problem.

586
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,180
So how can we do that?

587
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,280
hopefully you've already come up with an idea or two we can come in with a grid row end and

588
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,940
There's a few options

589
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,820
I could choose

590
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,920
My three because remember we have a one here my line number two here or and my line number three down here

591
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,020
So I couldn't throw a three and then the layout is done

592
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,360
Or you might have said well

593
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,180
I can do a span and you're right you could you could they span, too

594
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,060
And then it's gonna start at the top and span across to exact same result

595
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,540
There's no difference between them. So there we go, we're spanning across the two of them that way

596
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,880
another option is to use the shorthand. So instead of writing all of this,

597
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,820
when you use the shorthand, you do grid row, and then you're saying, where do you want it to start?

598
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:55,120
And then where do you want it to end? So 1 over 3? we'll start at line number 1 and go 2

599
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,620
to 3, or you could do 1 over span 2. And that will give you the exact same result.

600
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,500
and you can just in this case where you're declaring a starting row, using

601
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,340
whether it's a span or whether it's something else it doesn't matter too

602
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,440
much if you like the idea of this actually being utility class just like I

603
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,340
did before you could come in and create something like that a grid row span to

604
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:29,140
and do a grid grow span to and use that in conjunction with a grid row Start

605
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,560
There's the possibility with things like that

606
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,300
that because this is a shorthand

607
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,660
it might actually get overridden

608
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,820
and you can run into a little bit of finickiness.

609
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,160
So if I need to do a specific starting line

610
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,880
or a specific ending line or anything like that,

611
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,020
I tend to declare it on the selector where I'm working

612
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,580
instead of using utility class.

613
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,780
But if I don't need to declare anything specific,

614
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,500
that's where I like the utility classes

615
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,400
that work based on just where its natural flow is.

616
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,900
And we're going to get to the media queries in one second

617
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,560
And I just want to recap a little bit

618
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,600
of the simplicity of this.

619
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,560
And I've gone over it before,

620
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,940
but first display grid because we need it.

621
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,580
GAP, because that makes our spacing

622
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,320
and our life easier there,

623
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,860
and then set up your columns.

624
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,140
Don't set up rows unless you have to.

625
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,540
We didn't have to in this case,

626
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,720
even though we did have to span multiple rows.

627
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,520
Pretty nice and pretty neat.

628
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,480
And I think makes things a lot easier to maintain

629
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,720
and a lot easier to think about.

630
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,920
We can use spans,

631
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
just to span columns.

632
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,960
It doesn't matter where things are starting.

633
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,540
And then if you need to,

634
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,320
we can do specific things of start in this exact location

635
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,460
or start here and end over here and different things like that.

636
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,700
So, always do as general as possible and as generic as possible.

637
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,720
Simplify things as much as possible

638
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,580
and then, when you need to get very specific,

639
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,920
then add that specificness to your grid

640
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,960
just to get things to fall where they need to.

641
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,360
But a lot of the time, you don't even need stuff like this.

642
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,140
This is really when you're getting into these weird layouts like this

643
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,800
where things are sort of getting a little fancier.

644
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,840
And next, we want our immediate queries.

645
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,580
So, I'm gonna open up responsive mode,

646
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,620
the shortcut is Shift-Command-M.

647
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,720
I dunno know if that's probably a Command-Shift-M.

648
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,640
I'm guessing if you're on a Mac, that is in your dev tools.

649
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,640
Also, I get asked a lot about this, so that's this little guy.

650
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,580
Uh, not this little guy, this little guy in your dev tools.

651
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,340
And in Chrome, this exact same icon

652
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,700
is on this side over here.

653
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,060
So, just because I always get asked about this.

654
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,100
And I mentioned the nice thing with responsiveness in grid

655
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,040
So we will do an extra little stage in this

656
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,300
that wouldn't really be for this layout specifically.

657
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,140
But let's fix this at the beginning.

658
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,080
And this is where I can actually leave everything I've done,

659
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,900
except for one thing.

660
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,760
There's a few little things we'll have to do,

661
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
but I'm going to grab this grid template columns.

662
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm going to remove it from here and hit Save,

663
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,780
and let's see what happens.

664
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,980
We still have a layout.

665
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,060
And what I'm going to do is come here and say,

666
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,520
app media and we'll just say a min width of 40.

667
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,640
I'm guessing and let's put in my testimonial grid

668
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,260
and we're gonna redefine my columns there.

669
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,640
One thing you'll notice is even though,

670
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,180
actually let's just remove this

671
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,800
so we can see that we don't have anything.

672
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,500
We actually have a bit of,

673
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,860
the layout's working even though

674
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,580
I haven't declared my columns here.

675
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,060
But the columns spacing has gotten

676
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,280
a little mucked up because it's going to the autospacing

677
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,960
like this one.

678
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,080
You can see here we have a really narrow column,

679
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,120
here we have a bigger column.

680
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,180
So that's why I do like declaring them.

681
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,700
The reason that it's just magically working

682
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,500
is because of this grid column start.

683
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,800
If I turn this off,

684
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,740
the whole thing falls apart.

685
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,000
But it's going, this has to be on the fourth column.

686
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,760
So that means I need to have four columns for this to work

687
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,960
and then everything will just sort of

688
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,540
slot into those empty spaces.

689
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,880
So that's why we sort of have a layout right now.

690
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
But what we're gonna say is,

691
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,960
actually let's put it right here,

692
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,240
my media query,

693
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,780
and then I'm going to grab this

694
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,960
and also put it inside the media query.

695
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,460
And now we have this at my large screen sizes.

696
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,300
And then, I think we should change

697
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,640
where that's happening at.

698
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,540
And actually I'm going to bring this up to a 50

699
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,180
cause it was getting a little bit narrow there.

700
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,320
And we can see, there we go.

701
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,780
Look at that.

702
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,340
It's going and then it's working

703
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,140
except it's not really working

704
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,660
cause these are still spanning to.

705
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,220
This would depend a little bit on your layout

706
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,540
but I think most of the time

707
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,660
your spans are going to be happening

708
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,000
once the grid is sort of more defined.

709
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,980
and when things are kicking in.

710
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,920
So I'm also going to bring that utility class here.

711
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,340
This isn't the most organized CSS at the moment,

712
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,420
but just to say, we want to start without any spans,

713
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,200
without any columns, anything like that.

714
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,600
But I'm still using my display of grid

715
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,120
at the small screen size, because then I have my gap

716
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,340
and all my spacing is there.

717
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,500
And actually, let's just turn off

718
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
the inspector thing now.

719
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,640
So yeah, just for the purpose of having that gap,

720
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,460
I think that's wonderful.

721
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,280
And then we get to our larger screen size

722
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,040
and then we get our columns and everything falls in

723
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,460
and then we go back down that way.

724
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,640
And so that works really really nicely

725
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,760
and it's just about keeping things organized

726
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,860
within your media queries where you need them to be.

727
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,800
There are ways of working without media queries with...

728
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,460
you might see it with like a repeat autofit

729
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,360
and other things like that

730
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,580
that are actually fairly easy to use

731
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,980
but on a layout like this it just doesn't work

732
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,100
and I don't want to dive into it

733
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,600
because we're just adding...

734
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,720
we're keeping grid simple today.

735
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,060
Hopefully this is still keeping it very simple for you

736
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,420
and moving things into the media query

737
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,780
Hopefully it doesn't throw you off too much there.

738
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
But again all of this code,

739
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,940
if you want to look at it in more detail,

740
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,720
the GitHub repo is linked below

741
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,200
and you can access all the code there.

742
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,180
Now the last thing I want to talk about

743
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,300
that I find actually simplifies things

744
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,980
with grid a little bit is a way

745
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,100
that I used to not want to work at all.

746
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
But I find when it comes

747
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,600
to media queries and all of that,

748
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,460
it makes grid just wonderful.

749
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
And it does take a little bit more setup,

750
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,980
but I find it's a nice easy way

751
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,320
to work with grid when you have

752
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,980
more complex layouts like this.

753
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,760
In doing this, we're also gonna explore

754
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,600
a few other properties that we haven't looked at yet.

755
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,040
And so what I'm gonna do is, I'm actually gonna come

756
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,840
and I'm gonna delete all of this.

757
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm gonna delete the media query,

758
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,920
because we are gonna need it,

759
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,060
but I'm gonna delete all of that.

760
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,920
And we're left back where we started

761
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,620
with our display grid at the very beginning.

762
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,080
And this is just another approach,

763
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,560
it's why I'm breaking it sort of into two.

764
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,840
But it's one of my favorite ways to work with grid.

765
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,960
The way we just looked at, I think,

766
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,160
is the best way to understand

767
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
how grid is working,

768
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,020
and the simple ways of setting up

769
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,820
a nice simple grid.

770
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,040
This is when you need more complex layouts

771
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,280
with a little bit more happening

772
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,980
where things change a little bit more.

773
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,180
So we're going to break away from the actual design

774
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,860
as well a little bit with this one.

775
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,700
And what I'm going to do is actually set up

776
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,380
some grid template areas.

777
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,520
And with grid template areas,

778
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,140
the syntax of it's a little weird,

779
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,480
but I always, always do it where I put it onto its own line

780
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,740
because the grid template areas

781
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,160
tend to get a little bit complex,

782
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,000
and we're going to see that once we get to the media query,

783
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,380
it's going to have a little bit more going.

784
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,480
And it's also kind of weird because it does all go in strings

785
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,160
But I'm gonna write 1 here

786
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,700
and then actually gonna go on a new line and in quotations can be single or double quotations, three

787
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,300
and

788
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,240
five and

789
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,540
I always forget my semicolon at the end. So just don't forget after the last one

790
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,500
You do need a semicolon

791
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,240
and let's let's save and let's see what that's actually done because this has done something even though we don't see a difference yet and

792
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,120
And to be able to see it, once again,

793
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,760
we'll open up our visualization tools on my grid.

794
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,000
So we can open the grid here,

795
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,060
and I have line numbers enabled.

796
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,300
So if you don't see the line areas,

797
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,400
my area names are enabled.

798
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,740
So it's within the Layout tab,

799
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,240
this is in Chrome and in Firefox.

800
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,500
Chrome, it's these little, little tabs that show up here

801
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,740
whereas in Firefox they're really just in your face.

802
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,460
So I like the in your face ones a little bit better.

803
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,680
And we can see we have one, two, three, four,

804
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,840
and five at the bottom.

805
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
Now, what's the point of this?

806
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,720
Let's go down into my media query

807
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,720
and here we're gonna write testDemonialGrid

808
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,980
and we're gonna say gridTemplateAreas

809
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,140
and we're gonna redefine them.

810
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,380
So let's come here.

811
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,700
And what we're gonna say is we're gonna have...

812
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,960
We're gonna match the design for now.

813
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,600
So it's a one, one and five.

814
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,760
And let's go back into Figma.

815
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,400
And so if you remember in the markup

816
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,100
this is one, this is number two,

817
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,320
Then this is number three.

818
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,400
This is number four and then this one is number five.

819
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,700
And again, draw things.

820
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,440
So we have five here and five here,

821
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,340
four there, four here.

822
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,660
Let's make that four all in white

823
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,340
and then we have a one there and a one here.

824
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,660
So we have area one,

825
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,440
one, two, five.

826
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,100
And then we come down to this next row.

827
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,680
Three, four, four, five.

828
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,100
So I can write that

829
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,680
and I'd usually don't number it like this

830
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,120
I actually give the meaningful names

831
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,220
but so that was

832
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,440
three, four, five.

833
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,560
uh, four, four, or five?

834
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,140
Four, four, or five, and that was one, one,

835
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,020
it wasn't one, one, five, one, one, two, five.

836
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,580
There we go, two, five, and when we look at here,

837
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,320
what it did is it made one row for each of these.

838
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,140
So every set of quotation marks is going to be a row

839
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,020
and so here we just had one by itself,

840
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
two by itself, three by itself.

841
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,560
That's exactly what we see right now.

842
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,720
One, two, three, just like we have one, two, three,

843
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,840
four, five here.

844
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,600
Every set of quotation marks here is the row

845
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,340
and then within this row

846
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm creating different columns and for each one of these columns. I'm giving them a name and so let's hit save and

847
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,240
Look at that some magic happened, but you'll notice it's not using the area as well

848
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,440
But here we can see I have 1 1 2

849
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,020
5 5 continues down here for goes across these two and three is here and we'll even notice it puts these like solid red

850
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,500
Lines around the areas

851
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,920
To highlight where they are in the visualization tools where is here like between 4 and 4 there's no solid red line

852
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,320
so it tries to help us show us where things are.

853
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,500
So that just means we need to use these grid areas

854
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,060
and again, is this more set-up.

855
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,940
Yes, it definitely is more set up

856
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,020
and I just find it works so well

857
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,580
once you've taken the time to do this.

858
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,020
I'm gonna use this because of the way the layout is

859
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,380
with the nth-child Selector.

860
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,900
A lot of the time I'm doing this on a component

861
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,920
that has like, you know, it might be your name,

862
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,960
your name, your role, a description, an image.

863
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,660
So you can choose those selectors

864
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,360
that you've already made in those classes

865
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,260
and be applying all of that to those.

866
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,080
But what we'll do is we'll come here.

867
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,640
We'll say, and I'll set this up really fast.

868
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
So we'll fast forward for a second.

869
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,330
Okay, so I've set up my nth-child selectors

870
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,930
and each one is my testimonie nth-child,

871
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,730
so my first child, second child, third child,

872
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,530
fourth child, and my fifth child,

873
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,630
and then to place something on a grid area

874
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,410
you just want to come in and say

875
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,930
what grid area they should be living on.

876
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,550
So my first one should be living on grid area one,

877
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,990
and you'll notice here

878
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,990
here, it's not in quotation marks and this is something I think gets some people caught

879
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,390
off guard.

880
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,530
Here they're using one, here we're setting everything in like a string type of thing.

881
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,490
It's in quotation marks, here you don't use quotation marks.

882
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:46,870
Just to be aware of that and then we can do a two and then we can use a three and we can

883
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,950
put a four and then we can set a five here.

884
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:54,510
Hit save and my layout comes together there's one issue with it but look at that.

885
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,310
it's come together and then we can shrink that down

886
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,950
and it pops over and then comes back and what I really like about grid areas

887
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,650
is, check this out! Let's take this guy, copy them and paste

888
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,770
them. And maybe we do this at 30 rem instead

889
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,310
so we're going to create two different ones

890
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:17,250
and we do one one um let's just do one one then we'll do a

891
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,310
two five a three five

892
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:27,150
And then a four, five, and hit save.

893
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,990
And so now let's go all the way down.

894
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,930
They all stack on top of each other,

895
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:31,830
just like we had it.

896
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,290
Then I come to here and I get my one, two,

897
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,430
five, three, five, four five.

898
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,710
Doesn't really work with this layout,

899
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,530
but you can see it's going.

900
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,730
Or so maybe we do four, four then across the bottom.

901
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,810
And then we hit that.

902
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,410
There we go.

903
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,810
So we have this layout like that

904
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,110
and then we do a larger layout

905
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,990
and then it goes that way.

906
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,070
and you can just change the layout how you need to

907
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,330
at different screen sizes so easily.

908
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,410
And what I really love with this

909
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,090
is I'm only worried about the parent.

910
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,790
I don't have to do anything on the children.

911
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,830
This is the children.

912
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,610
I set the grid area they live on.

913
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,670
I never have to worry about it again,

914
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,190
which is just so magical.

915
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,630
And for this to be working at this stage,

916
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,650
all I've done is display grid, a gap

917
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,870
and a grid template areas,

918
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,750
and then I'm just redefining the grid template areas

919
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,510
for each one.

920
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,510
And with the visualization and seeing,

921
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,750
Oh, I have a grid area here. I have the grid area here

922
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,110
I find this

923
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:27,270
So easy, and so simple to work this way, and I don't even need spans because I'm saying that my one

924
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,510
Let's go find him my grid area one

925
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,850
Your living on grid area one and grid area one is going across two different columns

926
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,910
So it's going to span those two columns. It's wonderful. Now, you might have noticed we ran into that issue

927
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,770
I talked about when I deleted my display

928
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,630
When I deleted the grid template

929
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,790
columns that I'd originally set up with that repeat syntax,

930
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,890
where the columns are different sizes.

931
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,010
This one's really small and this one's bigger,

932
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,950
just because of the way the content is distributed

933
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,730
and it's doing its automatic thing to make it work.

934
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,750
Which is cool, and it may be that's happy

935
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,410
and maybe this is exactly what you need.

936
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,350
But if you do wanna ensure that you have

937
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,330
columns that are always the same size

938
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,090
and you're not actually setting up any columns,

939
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,970
we can do this in one spot,

940
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,350
and then never have to worry about it,

941
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,590
which is coming here and saying grid auto columns.

942
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,030
Because these columns are automatically being generated

943
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,150
based on my grid template areas,

944
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,170
so it's grid auto columns,

945
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,550
and then you say what size you want them to be.

946
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,310
And that means any automatically generated column,

947
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,590
and you can do the same for rows.

948
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,690
Any automatically generated column will be 1FR.

949
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,150
So if I hit save, now each column is the same size,

950
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,730
we get nice even columns,

951
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,670
and the layout becomes a little bit more balanced.

952
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,350
And if you really like this grid template areas approach of working,

953
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,370
but you want to see it with an example where I'm not using nth child and I'm

954
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,950
actually doing it in a bit more realistic of a situation perhaps there's a

955
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,730
video here for viewing pleasure that you can check out.

956
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:52,950
Right,

957
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,490
I dive a lot deeper into that and with that a really big thank you to all of my

958
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,710
patrons for their monthly support.

959
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,190
I can't do it without you guys and until next time,

960
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,810
don't forget to make your part of the Internet just a little bit more awesome.
